    of Nova Scotia and a large number of people. Following an eloquent address 
    in Latin, several items, including daily newspapers and coins, were deposited 
    in the cavity before the cornerstone was sealed in place. The building was 
    designed in the gothic style by a well-known Halifax architect, Henry Eliot,

    main body of walling to be of red brick, relieved and lightened by the introduction 
    of a considerable quantity of light-colored sandstone from the Albert quarries

    fire in the school house where some chairs and portions of the floor were 
    ablaze. The destruction of St. Luke’s hastened the construction of All Saints 
    Cathedral which was completed on its present site in 1910. </p>

mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>During the First World War
weekly services were held in St. Luke’s Hall for 300 Russian labourers who had
been brought to Halifax to work on the construction of the ocean terminals. The
services were conducted by the Rev. V. E. Harris, an Anglican clergyman, who
had learned enough of the Russian language to preach to his congregation in
Russian. In 1915 Bishop Alexander, of the Russian Orthodox Church, came from
New York and conducted a three-hour service in the hall. The weekly offerings
of the congregation were set aside by Harris and later donated to the Hellenic
community toward the purchase of a church. When this sum was handed over to the
community in 1940 it amounted to $700 and encouraged other contributions;
within a year enough money had been raised to pay for a church. </p>

mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>In the years between the two
world wards, St. Luke’s Hall was an active social centre for the Anglican
community in south end Halifax. On Sundays, the hall was transformed into 12-14
little curtained classrooms for Sunday school. Throughout the week, a variety
of groups, including the Boy Scouts, a youth club, and a women’s’ sewing group,
met in the hall. Teas, suppers, dances and plays were regular events. During
the 1930 the hall was also used for recreational badminton and for the weekly
games of a church badminton league. All these events took place in the area
which is now used for the church. The downstairs portion of the building was
used for rummage sales and also contained a small room where the Boy Scouts
kept their equipment. At election times the downstairs became a polling
station.</p>

mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>The earliest Hellenes arrived
in Halifax in the first decade of the twentieth century and by the early 1930s
there were about 25 families living in the city. In the 1932, the tiny
congregation was able to obtain the services of a priest, the Rev. Theodore
Scartsiades, whose duties included regular trips to Saint John and Glace Bay
where several Hellenic families had also settled. In Halifax, services were
held in rented premises on the corner of Hollis and Sackville streets. On May
2, 1934, an Act of Incorporation was passed in the provincial legislature
officially establishing the Greek Orthodox Church in Nova Scotia. </p>

mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>On January 25, 1941, the
trustees purchased St. Luke’s Hall from the Anglican Diocese for the sum of
$6,000. Because of its architecture, the ample space for a church upstairs and
a hall beneath, and because of its location in south-end Halifax where most of
the congregation lived, the new church was ideally suited to the needs of the
Hellenic community at that time.</p>

the church welcomed many seamen and armed forces personnel who visited or were
stationed in Halifax. The hall was the scene of many social activities
including events to entertain the servicemen and to support the war effort. For
15 months in 1943-44, the hall was transformed into a depot for clothing and
materials, including 15,000 pairs of shoes, which were collected by the War
Relief Committee for distribution in Greece. </p>

    of the building were completed in 1943 at a cost of $12,500. The domed ceiling 
    was installed and the iconostasis (screen between altar and congregation) 
    was added, along with pews for the congregation. A wall was erected along 
    the back of the church to form a hallway leading from the front door to the 
    back stairway. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>On the evening of March 
    9, 1950, a fire originating in the basement did extensive damage to the <span class=GramE>church,</span> 
    necessitating the replacement of the exterior brickwork of the side walls. 
    At this time the original slate roofing tiles, which were in poor condition, 
    were also replaced. Total cost of the renovations and repairs was $20,000.

rapidly in the post war years. By the 1970s there were over 250 families living
in the Halifax Dartmouth area. The little church was filled with parishioners
for regular Sunday services. At Christmas, Easter and during other special
observances, members of the congregation had to stand in the aisles, the
hallway, and even on the sidewalk outside the church. </p>

mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>In December 1974, the decision 
    was taken to purchase a 4.5 acre lot on the shores of the North West Arm’s 
    Melville cove. The lot was owned by the Rocca Group, a development company, 
    which was planning to build a motel on the side but was unsuccessful in having 
    the site rezoned for commercial use. In <span class=GramE>May<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>1977</span>, the sod was turned for a community 
    centre, designed by Gregory Lambros, and five years later, in the summer of 
    1982, construction of the new church was begun. The church was designed by 
    the firm of Dumaresque and Byrne to incorporate Byzantine features of architecture, 
    including a large cupola which was fastened in place on January 28, 1984. 
    The interior of the church <span class=GramE>is</span> now nearing completion 
    and it is expected that it will be consecrated during the coming summer.</p>

mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>The Hellenic community would
like to retain possession of St. George’s; however, the responsibility of
maintaining two churches would place a significant financial burden on the
small community which numbers about 300 families. There has been much
speculation about what could be done with the little church but, to date, no
decision has been taken on its future. Whatever fate now awaits St. George’s,
the church will always hold a special significance for members of the Hellenic
community as well as for those who still remember it as St. Luke’s Hall.</p>
