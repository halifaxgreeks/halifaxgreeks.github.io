<h1><st1:place w:st="on">Cape <span class=GramE>Breton<span
 style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Island</span></st1:place></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span></b>Shortly after 1900 several Greek
men arrived on <st1:place w:st="on">Cape Breton Island</st1:place> to work in
the coal mines. In his well-researched book, <u>The Greeks in Cape Breton<span
class=GramE>, <span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Prof</span></span></u>. George Gekas points
out that many of the earliest Greek immigrants to <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName> came from mining areas in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> such as <span class=SpellE>Lavrion</span>
and <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Euboea</span></st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if the men had never mined in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>, they were recruited by the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
mining companies, and especially by the Dominion Coal Company. At a 1914
company party 154 Greek miners were counted. These men had been living in a
number of poorly equipped shacks near the <st1:place w:st="on">Caledonia</st1:place>
mine. This was the time period when mining in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
was probably at its most difficult, and when living conditions for the miners
were generally very bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>Peter <span
class=SpellE>Parousis</span>, who had come from the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType>
of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Paros</span></st1:PlaceName> in
1911, was one early Greek who worked in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
mines for his entire life, but he was an exception. The deep underwater coal
mines of <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>
turned out to be very different from the surface or short tunnel mines which
were common in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because of this, many of the early Greek
miners in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> turned to other types of
employment, where they could, or left the island. As they turned in large
numbers from working in the mines, like Greek immigrants elsewhere in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the Cape Breton
Greek men first worked in, and then opened their own restaurants, sweet shops,
shoe repair shops and other businesses. For example, Mr. Nick <span
class=SpellE>Vallas</span> owned a series of businesses in the 1930s and 1940s.
First he opened an ice cream parlor in New Waterford, and later he <span
class=GramE>owned<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and</span> operated
the <span class=SpellE>Latona</span> Restaurant in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Sydney</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Still later he sold the restaurant to another Greek family: the <span
class=SpellE>Rossos</span> family. The <span class=SpellE>Dragatses</span>
Grocery Store in Glace Bay was owned by three brothers-John, Basil, and Nick <span
class=SpellE>Dragatsis</span>- who had come to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
from <st1:place w:st="on">Crete</st1:place>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Their grocery store is remembered as the place where tram conductors
were told to drop off any newly-arrived Greeks so that they could receive
assistance and shelter. <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Dragatses</span> Street</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:place
w:st="on">Glace Bay</st1:place> <span class=SpellE>honours</span> the memory of
these fine Greek Canadians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>After young
Steve <span class=SpellE>Markadonis</span> had been refused entry to the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> in 1911, he and his father George
reached <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> to work in the mines. Since they
did not <span class=GramE>wish</span> to stay in the mining industry, the
father and son eventually opened a shoe repair shop in <st1:place w:st="on">Glace
 Bay</st1:place>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1917 George <span
class=SpellE>Markadonis</span> went to <st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State>
to meet his wife <span class=SpellE>Eleni</span> and the rest of their children
who had just arrived from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
This family prospered in <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName> and eventually helped others from their native
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Milos</span></st1:PlaceName> to come to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was George <span class=SpellE>Markadonis</span>
who donated a building site for the first and only Greek <span class=GramE>church</span>
on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Though many of
the first Greek immigrants to <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName> were bachelors or men whose wives and families
were still in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
gradually men <span class=GramE>arranged<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>for</span> their families to join them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A few men did arrive on the <st1:place w:st="on">Island</st1:place> with
their wives and families.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The three
earliest Greek wives known to reach <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName> were <st1:place w:st="on"><span
 class=SpellE>Maritsa</span></st1:place> (<span class=SpellE>Rossos</span>) <span
class=SpellE>Vallas</span>, Sophia (<span class=SpellE>Philihos</span>) <span
class=SpellE>Markotjohn</span>, <span class=GramE>and<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Irene</span> (<span class=SpellE>Vallas</span>)
<span class=SpellE>Dezagiacomo</span>. These pioneer Greek women are remembered
for the care and strength that they gave their husbands and families.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From time to time some of them worked in
various family businesses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most had
rudimentary English and must have found life very difficult, when they ventured
outside their homes to confront the non-Greek environment of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>The early
years of the Greek community in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> were marked by a
terrible event.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In September 1930 Nick <span
class=SpellE>Marathos</span>, a well-liked and hardworking fireman at both No.
2 coal mine and the Caledonia mine, was found bleeding to death on a lonely
road outside Glace Bay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently he
had been killed for the money he was carrying and for his gold watch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His killer was later convicted and
executed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This violent death caused
tremendous upset in the small Cape Breton Greek community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>When <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> was
under occupation by the Italian and German forces in World War II, the Greek
government in exile established the position of Greek Port Master in several
countries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:City w:st="on">Sydney</st1:City>,
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>
was one place in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that had a Greek Port Master.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Sydney
Port Master had to see that Greek government regulations were enforced on all
Greek ships visiting the port, and that the Greek sailors received their proper
food, accommodations etc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also
acted as liaison officers with the Canadian Department of Defense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Until 1960 many Greek ships came to <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their arrival was the opportunity for the
Cape Breton Greek people to meet and entertain the Greek crews.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes they gave financial assistance to
stranded Greek sailors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During World War
II, the Greek ships <span class=SpellE>Emy</span> and <span class=SpellE>Aikaterini</span>
(whose crews were well-known on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>) were sunk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE>Emy</span> went down
just outside <st1:place w:st="on">Glace Bay</st1:place>s <span class=SpellE>harbour</span>,
almost certainly sunk by German submarines.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Because the timber cargo from the ship floated in the water, the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Bretoners</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place> were able to save
most of the crew. The <span class=SpellE>Aikaterini</span>, on the other
hand, was lost with the entire crew while en route to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Saint John</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">New Brunswick</st1:State></st1:place>.
The cause of the <span class=SpellE>Aikaterini</span> sinking was never
determined. Since the 1970s only a few Greek ships dock in <st1:City w:st="on">Sydney</st1:City>
to pick up coal and steel rails, and the position of Greek Port Master no
longer exists, but the spirit of Greek hospitality on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
still holds strong for any visiting Greek sailors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>Although many
Cape Breton Greek families have now been in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
for decades, they continue to hold fond memories of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Before his death in 1947,
Mr. George <span class=SpellE>Markadonis</span> sent money to purchase a clock
for the tower of his hometown church on the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on"><span
  class=SpellE>Milos</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Vasilis</span> <span
class=SpellE>Hilakos</span> helped his home village build a central square with
facilities for running spring water. Like Greeks elsewhere in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:place></st1:State>, the Cape Breton Greek community
gave generously to the Greek War Relief Fund, especially after 1948. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>A major disaster
occurred in November 1961, when, along with another non-Greek individual, four
prominent members of the Cape Breton Greek community drowned, while trying to
bring a cabin cruiser into <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sydney</st1:place></st1:City>s
port during a severe storm. Suddenly Emmanuel <span class=SpellE>Xidos</span>,
his brother-in-law John <span class=SpellE>Farmakoulas</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Costas</span> <span class=SpellE>Vihos</span> and Emmanuel <span
class=SpellE>Raptis</span> were taken. In the 1950s Emmanuel <span
class=SpellE>Xidos</span> and John <span class=SpellE>Farmakoulas</span> had
sponsored almost 200 Greek immigrants to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Emmanuel <span
class=SpellE>Xidos</span> owned or managed a chain of shoe repair businesses
reaching throughout Atlantic Canada to <st1:State w:st="on">Quebec</st1:State>
and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ontario</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Together Emmanuel Xidos and John Farmakoulas
developed a dry cleaning and laundry business called <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Koolex</b>, a combination of their family names.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This dry cleaning business was also expanding
through Atlantic Canada at the time of the deaths. The sudden deaths of such
leaders in the Cape Breton Greek community was a blow, first of all to their
own families, but to the community at large, and to their growing businesses
which now ceased to exist or were sold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>As was the case
in other parts of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region> and
<st1:State w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:State>, in the 1950s and 60s new
individuals and families arrived on Cape Breton Island from a variety of places
in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About one dozen additional families emigrated
from <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:country-region> to <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>
in the troubled years of the 1970s, as tensions increased between <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>. All of these people had
family members or friends already living there. Most of them were young couples
with children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their arrival was viewed
as an opportunity to increase and enhance the Greek nature of the community
which many of the senior members feared was being lost. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>The reality in <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>
has been that young Greek Canadians have been moving away to seek employment in
other parts of the province and country which do not have the intense economic
problems of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>An additional worry (at least for the older members of the Cape Breton
Greek community) is that many of the younger people have married non-Greeks and
now have few contacts with their Greek heritage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While many people of Greek background on <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>
support Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span>, the Greek Orthodox Church in
<st1:place w:st="on">Glace Bay</st1:place>, others have now become regular
members of non-Orthodox churches, particularly of the Roman Catholic Church. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Today there are
about 200 people of Greek ancestry living on <st1:place w:st="on">Cape Breton
 Island</st1:place>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of these
Greeks are located in the industrial areas of <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName> with the largest percentage
being in or near <st1:City w:st="on">Sydney</st1:City>, <st1:place w:st="on">Glace
 Bay</st1:place>, and New Waterford. Like Greek immigrants to other parts of <st1:State
w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:State> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>,
most of the first-generation Greeks to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType

had low levels of formal education. Only three individuals are known to have
had a university degree at the time they came to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The second and third-
generation Greeks in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> are increasingly well
educated. Many Cape Breton Greeks have sent their children to the University
College of Cape Breton, but other young people have gone to universities
outside of <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>,
particularly to <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Dalhousie</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>.
The young Cape Breton Greeks have entered a variety of careers, with teaching
being one of their most popular choices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>In the early
1980s Wanda <span class=SpellE>Pierrynowski</span> found five Greek Canadian
women in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> who were actively involved in
either operating or assisting with the operation of small businesses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These businesses included three tailor shops,
a shoe store, and a clothing store.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
women said that they received moral support for their work from their husbands
who operated other businesses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One or
two said that their husbands provided assistance with building maintenance or
bookkeeping, but in essence these women ran their own businesses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From <span class=SpellE>Pierrynowskis</span>
data and from those conducted by the author, it was found that many other <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
women have worked and now do work outside their homes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is very different from the earlier years
of the Greek people on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, when few Greek
wives and mothers had lives separate from their families. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Greek people on <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>
have become active, well-integrated members of <st1:place w:st="on">Island</st1:place>
life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While there have been efforts from
time to time to establish particularly Greek organizations like AHEPA and the
Ladies <span class=SpellE>Philoptochos</span>, these have generally faltered
and disappeared. Instead the adults have become loyal members of local organizations
such as the Lions Club, and have taken up popular community interests such as
hockey and curling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their children play
baseball, hockey, soccer, and basketball, and also join the Scouts and Guides.
The Cape Breton Greeks have made many firm friends among people who are not
Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In an interview conducted in the
1980s elderly Mr. Nick <span class=SpellE>Raptis</span> of <st1:City w:st="on">Sydney</st1:City>
described how happy he had been living in <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>, and said that he had no wish
to return to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When his eyesight deteriorated and he had to
stop driving his car, he allowed his next-door <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>,
a Presbyterian minister, to park his car in the now empty driveway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In return, the grateful <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>
cut Mr. <span class=SpellE>Raptis</span> grass for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Mrs. Katherine <span
class=SpellE>Farmakoulas</span>, widow of John <span class=SpellE>Farmakoulas</span>
from the 1961 boating accident described above, is a lively Greek senior whom
we had the pleasure to interview early in 2000. She is the long-time president
of Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyroi</span> Orthodox Church in <st1:place w:st="on">Glace
 Bay</st1:place>, and has a special permission or blessing from the Greek
bishop to look after the sanctuary of the church. In the interview she said:
My father came to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1914.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a couple of years he returned to our
village on <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Milos</span></st1:place>,
where he met and married my mother. Father came to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
in 1925 to work in the mines, but he did not stay long in that difficult
environment. Instead, he started various businesses in <st1:place w:st="on">Glace
 Bay</st1:place>. My father went back and forth to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
over the years, but the rest of us did not come to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> until 1940.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My father had never seen my youngest sister
Vickie, before she arrived in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
When I first reached here at sixteen, I remember being sad, because I had left
behind my friends and my school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After
we had arrived in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State>,
I found it very dark, and all that I could see were what I thought to be big
wooden barns. I asked my father where the people lived. He laughed and told me
that the wooden barns were houses, but that I should not judge by appearances,
because the houses were larger and much warmer than those in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>When we came to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> none of
us children went to school, but rather started working with our father. I tried
school here in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but I felt so out-of-place after a couple of weeks, that I decided not to go
back. I did not give up learning the language, but instead started studying
English at home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1948 I returned to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> for a
visit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thats where I met my husband who
was studying law in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Athens</st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We got married and came together to live in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At first it was very difficult for my
husband- and for me- to adjust to the lifestyle here, but eventually we
did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We used to invite other Greeks,
especially young Greeks who did not have families here in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>, to
Sunday dinners, or for Greek Easter, or for Christmas.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We had our family 
    growing up and my husband was very active in the business life of Atlantic 
    Canada. Then I lost him in that boating accident. Somehow I went on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My children are all grown now with families 
    of their own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some family members live 
    close to me in Glace Bay, others are in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My daughter Irene is married to Louis Angelopoulos, 
    co-owner with his brother of the Halifax <span class=SpellE>Koolex</span> 
    <span class=SpellE>Kleaners</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I 
    stay active in my church in Glace Bay, I visit my family in <st1:City w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City>, 
    and sometimes I still travel to <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Milos</span></st1:place>. 
    Its a busy life. Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Farmakoulas</span> grit and spirit, 
    and her dedication to church, community, and family seem to be characteristic 
    of the best features <span class=GramE>of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>life</span> among <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> 
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>s Greek Canadians.
