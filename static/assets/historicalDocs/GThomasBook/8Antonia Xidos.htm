<h1><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Antonia Xidos</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>After sailing to
Canada from Greece on the ‘Anna Maria’, Mrs. Antonia Xidos arrived in Halifax
through Immigration at Pier 21 on August 11, 1958.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She told the author: “I left my island of
Milos because my fiancé had come here earlier. He was related to the Cape
Breton Farmakoulas family, and first was sent to work in their
Newfoundland<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Koolex Kleaners operation.
However, he hated it there and after two years he came to live in Nova Scotia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First he arranged for his brothers to come to
Canada, and then he arranged for me. Back home on Milos life was
difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My father had died of
starvation in 1941 during the war, and my mother struggled with work to keep
the rest of us alive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>My first
impression of Canada was not a positive one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I remember coming out of the ship, and the only thing I could see was
dense fog everywhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the first
couple of years were very difficult for me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I did not know any English at all. I remember going to the supermarket
and wanting to buy sugar, but instead I ended up buying salt! For the first few
years in Canada I hated it. I was homesick and wanted desperately to return to
Greece. I also remember that in our first home on Barrington Street six people
used to live in a two-bedroom apartment with one kitchen and bathroom. Though
the building wasn’t owned by a Greek, it seemed that almost everyone there in
those apartments was Greek, and many of us worked at Koolex Kleaners in the
south end of the city.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>[Mrs. Xidos’
daughter, Cathy Mavrogiannis, interjected here: “I still meet older Greek
ladies who remind me that they used to take care of me for my mother when she
was working, and then she would do the same for their children.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So I had a whole set of other ‘mothers’ who
have remained close to us all these years.”]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Mrs. Xidos
continued: “Eventually we opened Ship Shape, a laundry/dry cleaning business in
Eastern Passage outside Dartmouth which had an apartment for us upstairs. After
renting the premises for a time, we bought the building. Back then the Greek
community was very small, but we were very close to one another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every Sunday we went to church and I often
had parties for our Greek friends. Gradually things became easier for us, but
we have also have had some real troubles in our life here. One of my little
sons died in hospital. It nearly broke my heart. In 1966 there was a fire at
the business, and everything went up in flames. We started again, but in 1991
we had another fire caused by arson, which again destroyed everything we owned.
However, we rebuilt the building and business still again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This time we bought a home near my daughter’s
house, because we wanted to be closer to her and her family. Now I am so
terrified of fire that I can’t bear to live near the business again. Presently
our laundry and dry cleaning business is doing very well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has really expanded, and all our children
are involved in some aspect of it. I go there every day, because it gives me
the opportunity to stay in contact with our customers.” </p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Xidos ended the interview by saying, “Although 
    we do not have much free time, we always try to help the Greek community in 
    any way we can.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband used to 
    help with the Greek school, we contribute our money, and I bake for all the 
    different events. In conclusion, I do not regret the decision to come to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>, though 
    at times it has been very hard. Because of the first fire at Ship Shape we 
    had to delay our planned trip home, and my dear mother died before I was able 
    to get to <st1:place w:st="on">Milos</st1:place>. In Canada my children have 
    received a good education and two of them have university degrees. They have 
    made good lives for themselves and their children.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now Canada is ‘home’, but I still try to visit 
    our relatives in Greece with a trip there every two years.”</p>
