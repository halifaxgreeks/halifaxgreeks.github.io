<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The following

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>That is not to say that the individuals in
the profiles are somehow more important than other Maritime Greeks, or to
suggest that their contributions to life here are more significant. However,
these people were gracious enough to agree to interviews, and I hope that they
seem to be a representative sample of various occupations and interests among
local Greek Canadians. Logistical constraints, especially involving distances
and the difficulties associated with arranging interviews, placed limits on the
numbers and types of profiles. The author’s original intent here was to focus
on the categories of culture, church, business, and professions, and then to
interview individuals who fit those different divisions. She soon found that
people’s lives were too complex, too multi faceted to pigeonhole them in one
particular category. <span class=GramE>Many thanks to all those who agreed to
be interviewed.</span> </p>

  <h1><a name="JohnAngelopoulos"></a>John Angelopoulos</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span></b>Mr. John Angelopoulos had his first
term as Council president of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">St. George’s</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> from 1986 – 88, and his second term
as president from 1995-99. Disliking the military dictatorship in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>, he came to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:place></st1:State> from <span class=SpellE>Nafpactos</span>
in 1968 to join other family members here. Having lived first in <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>
and then in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montreal</st1:place></st1:City>
for several years, in 1972 he joined his brother Louis in business. In 1974 the
two brothers decided to buy the <st1:City w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City> branch
of the <span class=SpellE>Koolex</span> <span class=SpellE>Kleaners</span>
operation from the <span class=SpellE>Farmakoulas</span>/ <span class=SpellE>Xidos</span>
families of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>John has three
strong passionate interests in his life – his family, the Greek <span
class=GramE>church</span>, and his flourishing dry cleaning business.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He speaks with great pride about his wife
Maria, who has just completed her Ph.D. in Psychology, and about his three
children. He says that his children, unlike him, who is a Greek Canadian, are
Canadian Greeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For him the slight
differences in wording are clearly significant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>When John
Angelopoulos was asked to name a highlight in his years as Council president,
he answered immediately, “The first Greek Festival in 1986.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Father <span class=SpellE>Elles</span> (the
priest at the time) and I were so worried.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We had spent $10,000 of the people’s money in preparation for the
Festival. Would we lose their money?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
weekend started on Friday with rain, and our big tent was leaking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What would <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>’s people think of us?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By Saturday evening those worries were
receding, but we had a new one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In spite
of all the food which the people had prepared, we had virtually none left.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those wonderful Greek women and our Greek
restaurant owners went home to cook and bake all night, and on Sunday we fed
thousands more people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like most groups
we sometimes have our differences of opinions among ourselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once the Festival was on and we all worked
beside each other – I remember that I was next to someone who had disagreed
with me about something – the tension went away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Festival had brought our people
together.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My favorite memory is of a
young boy who attended our first Festival with his mother.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As he watched the dancers, heard the music,
and ate our Greek food, I overheard him turn to his mother and say, ‘Mom, how
come we are not Greek?’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>John went on, “There are so many good
memories. In 1987 the various Foreign Affairs Ministers for NATO were meeting
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> and
we hosted a reception for them in our community centre.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1984 and again in 1998, we entertained the
captain, crew, and 300 cadets from the Greek training ship ‘Ares’.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a wonderful opportunity for our young
people to meet all those fine, educated, young Greeks from home.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Speaking about
his business life, Mr. Angelopoulos told us that he and his brother now own
thirteen dry cleaning stores with about forty full-time employees as well as
contract workers. These stores operate in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Regional</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Municipality</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> under the
names <span class=SpellE>Koolex</span> <span class=SpellE>Kleaners</span> and
Don <span class=SpellE>Schelew</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He described the meticulous care and attention to detail which the dry
cleaning business demands-and receives- from its owners. In all aspects of
their business these two brothers have clearly combined the Greek approach to
hard work with North American professional expertise. Some of his favorite
business stories involve the number of wedding dresses which he has been asked
to clean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In one particular instance a
young woman had brought him a dress, saying that it was her mother’s and
grandmother’s, and was badly discolored with wear and time. He cleaned the
dress for her – and it came out almost as good as new. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Summing up his
business policy in these words, John said, “It’s the challenge in the work
which makes you want to do the best job that you can. When I am able to help a
customer no one else can help, I get a real feeling of satisfaction with the
service we provide.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is justifiably
proud that the chemicals he uses are safe for the employees, the customers, and
for the environment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Involved in every
aspect of his work, <span class=GramE>John<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Angelopoulos</span> has served on the boards of numerous professional
associations, including a term as president of The Fabric Care Association of
Canada.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is a strong advocate for
increased training and regulations for individuals who want to open or buy a
dry cleaning business. Right now, he says, the industry has few guidelines.
“They should teach courses on the proper use of chemicals in the dry cleaning
business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are regular courses for
plumbers, why not for people in our industry?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We could help the province set up those courses and provide apprentice
training programs.”</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>As both the past 
    president of the <st1:City w:st="on">St. George’s</st1:City> Church Council 
    and as the co-owner of a major dry cleaning business in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>, John Angelopoulos is dedicated and 
    hardworking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In speaking to him, one 
    cannot help but get a sense of the excitement and enthusiasm this very busy 
    man brings to everything in his active life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
