moves in the last few years to bring the church into more active involvement

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The world's Orthodox Christians
share a common doctrine which is similar to Roman Catholics and Anglicans in
their view of the sacraments, the importance of the Bible, veneration of
saints, and the authority of tradition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

Jesus, and a dislike for the ordination of women, but, unlike Roman Catholics,

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The first Greeks arrived in Halifax
in the early period of the twentieth century.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Before the 1930s this tiny group had to bring a priest from a nearby
Greek community in the United States for religious events like weddings and
baptisms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By the early 1930s this small,
dedicated group, spurred on by a newly formed organization, the
Greek-American-Progressive Association or Order of GAPA, was able to obtain the
services of a priest, the Rev. Theodore Scartsiades.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since there was no church building, the Greek
community held services in a rented premise on the corner of Sackville and
Hollis Streets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The new priest's duties
also included regular trips to Greek families residing in Saint John, New
Brunswick and Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On
May 2,1934 the Nova Scotia provincial legislature passed an Act of
Incorporation officially establishing the Greek Orthodox Church of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nova Scotia.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Peter Poulos, Nicholas Aliotis, Augustus Manolopoulos, James Bastas, and
Velis Lemonides were named in the Act as the trustees for the church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>On January 25,1941 the trustees of the
Greek Church in Halifax purchased St. Luke's Hall on the corner of Morris and
Queen Streets from the Anglican Diocese of Nova Scotia for $6,000.00.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Members of the Greek community had been
saving their money towards this goal for years, and near the end of their fund
raising years they received a generous donation of $800.00 in the will of a
local Anglican priest, Rev. V.R. Harris.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The new building had a very suitable architectural style with ample
space for a church upstairs and a hall downstairs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because of its location in south-end Halifax
where most of the congregation then lived, the new St.George's Greek Orthodox
Church suited the Hellenic community in Halifax very well for many years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>During World War II St. George's Church
welcomed many seamen and other armed forces personnel of the allied services
who visited or were stationed in Halifax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The church hall was used to entertain the service men and support the
war effort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1943-44 the church hall
became a depot for clothing and other materials, including 15,000 pairs of
shoes, which were collected by the War Relief Commission for distribution in
Greece.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>The Hellenic community in Halifax grew
rapidly in the post war years, as many Greeks left the ravages of a desperately
poor, still fractured homeland in Europe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>By the 1970s the Halifax metropolitan area had over 250 families of
Greek descent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The little St. George's
Church was filled for regular Sunday service, and on special occasions like
Christmas and Easter members of the congregation had to stand in the aisles,
the hallway, downstairs, or even outside on the Queen Street sidewalk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then in December 1974 the Halifax Greek
community succeeded in buying a 3.5 acre lot on the shores of the North West
Arm's Melville Cove.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In May 1977 the sod
for a community centre designed by Mr. Gregory Lambros, himself a member of the
church, was turned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Until 1982 the
church building in downtown Halifax continued to serve the spiritual needs of
the community, while the new building on the Purcell's Cove Road functioned as
a social centre.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Construction of a new
church building above the community centre began on the Purcell's Cove site in 1982.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The church includes many traditional
Byzantine features, especially a large fiberglass dome and a full array of
beautifully painted icons completed in 1999.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The new St. George's was consecrated by Bishop Sotirios in May
1985.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the opening church service
municipal, provincial, and federal politicians, along with people from outside
and inside the Greek community gathered together in celebration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a mark of support for the initiative and
hard work of the Nova Scotia Greek community the federal and provincial
governments had given substantial sums of money to the new church's
construction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, the Greek
people of the province bore the heaviest part of the financial load themselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In spite of some regret on the part of the
congregation, the small, older St. George's building downtown was sold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Since 1952 the Greek community on Cape
Breton Island has had their own church on Marconi St. in Glace Bay dedicated to
the Saints Anargyroi.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Saints
Anargyroi were two doctors named Cosmas and Damian who were well known for
their healing powers which they gave freely without charge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The church name <span class=SpellE><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Anargyroi</b></span> thus means the Saints
&quot;who have no money&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because
the small Greek community on Cape Breton Island cannot afford to maintain a full-time
priest, the Greek priest who is based in Halifax visits the community seven or
eight times each year for church services and other ministerial duties.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>July 1, Canada Day, is also the feast day for
Saints Cosmas and Damian.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is one
occasion when the Greek priest from Halifax always makes a special effort to be
with the parishioners of Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span> in Glace
Bay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>The decision to build a Greek Orthodox
Church on Cape Breton took years of planning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was Mr. George <span class=SpellE>Markadonis</span>, more than any
other individual, who helped the project begin by donating a piece of his own
land in Glace Bay for a Greek Orthodox church. After Mr. <span class=SpellE>Markadonis</span>
death in 1947 the whole Greek Canadian community in Cape Breton worked together
to raise funds. In 1962-1963 the original small church was expanded and almost
doubled in size to its present capacity of about eighty people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a story that when the original Ss. <span
class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span> Church was being built, in line with Greek
tradition, a rooster was killed on the corner of the foundation in order to
bring good luck and to add strength to the workers. To remember the work and
dedication of George Markadonis, his picture was hung in the basement hall of
the church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>Today Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span>
congregation is small with only about thirty families. Simply, sadly, most
young Greeks in Cape Breton, like their non-Greek friends, have had to leave
the Island for economic reasons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
spite of the low numbers in the congregation a Sunday school meets every week
at Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span> where the children learn the
elements of Orthodoxy, some Greek language, as well as traditional poems and
history. The childrens Christmas concerts are said to be a delight for anyone
lucky enough to be present.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Strong
family ties between Greek Canadians in Cape Breton and those in the Halifax
area mean that parishioners of Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span> often
visit in Halifax and take part in the life of St. Georges there. Many of the
members of Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span> gave generously toward the
building of St. Georges. Mrs. Katherine Farmakoulas, the long-time president
of the Church Council at Ss. <span class=SpellE>Anargyrois</span> says:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The church life is a very important part of
the identity of all Greek Canadians in Cape Breton.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our culture and our religion are very

Dorchester Street in Saint John, New Brunswick has about eighty families with
approximately 250 parishioners, some of whom regularly travel from the cities
of Fredericton and <span class=SpellE>Moncton</span> to attend church services
and church activities in Saint John.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Church was built in 1952, and has a full-time priest. In spite of being a small
community, the church is fully self supporting, able to finance the costs for
the church building, the priests stipend and house, and the various church
activities. The Archbishop publicly praised the people of St. Nicholas for all
their initiative and success as a community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Recently the Church Council at St. Nicholas decided to improve the
buildings facilities, and to try and increase the active membership. All the
people are pleased to welcome five newly baptized babies to their church
family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gatherings or parties each year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like
other Greek populations all across Canada, March 25 and October 28 are always
remembered with special celebrations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Mr. Andreas <span class=SpellE>Zmboukis</span>, the current president of
the Council says: We were brought up to hate the Turks, but we dont do the
same to our kids. Were trying to pass on our history and our struggles to our
children. Our community also marks November 11, Remembrance Day, like the rest
of Canada. We celebrate Name Days, such as St. Andrews Day on November 30 and
St. Nicholas Day on December 6.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Council has a Youth Committee, but no youth groups have yet been formed.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Although their community is small, St.
Nicholas Church also maintains a Sunday school after church on Sunday mornings,
and a Greek school with classes meeting twice weekly. The parish priest is the
Greek schoolteacher. Students attending the Greek school are not only the
children of Greek parents, but adults who have married Greek Canadians and want
to learn the language<o:p></o:p></span></p>

English.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A priest for thirty-five years,
he first came to Canada in 1981 as a three-month replacement for a priest friend
in Toronto. Liking the freedom of Canadian life and the friendly Canadian
people, he decided to stay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From Toronto
he moved to a small, newly organized Greek parish in Montreal, where he
remained for fourteen years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of his
recent move to Saint John he says: Here I have found a very good, very
generous people. I go for a walk and people smile and say: Good Morning
Father, and How are you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Father <span
class=SpellE>Laspakis</span> makes an effort to conduct the church services
almost equally in Greek and English, in order to accommodate both the older,
fluent Greek speakers, and the younger parishioners whose Greek is weaker, or
in some cases, non existent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One female
parishioner has a special <span class=SpellE>episcopal</span> blessing to go
behind the iconostasis and assist the priest in preparing the altar for the
holy services. When Father <span class=SpellE>Laspakis</span> was asked, if
there are problems when a parishioner marries a non-Orthodox, non-Greek
speaker, he said: No, they are all Christians.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>God is love. It is clear from speaking to members of the Greek
community in Saint John that many people have married non-Orthodox Christians,
particularly Roman Catholics.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In such
marriages the couple often attends both churches and celebrates special feasts
like Easter with both Greek and non-Greek traditions.<span

generously to the building fund for the new St. George's Church, and they
continue to support it financially, though they may rarely visit Halifax.<span

community in an area to be invited to the wedding of a young couple in the
Greek Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A typical reception, which
includes a sumptuous Greek meal and dancing, follows in the social centre below
the Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek festivals and dances do
not only raise money, but they also provide a place where the whole community
can come together and participate in the familiar ways of the Hellenic
homeland.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This combination of the church
and the social life of the community is not something which has come to this
country from Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Greece the
church exists to maintain the Christian liturgies or church services, and to
provide the people with the familiar rites for birth, marriage, and death, but
it generally stands apart from their social world.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other, large North American cities where
many Greeks live, there is a growing divergence between Greek church and Greek
community, and an individual is not necessarily excluded from the life of the
Greek community, if s(he) does not have some attachment to the church.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For many individuals in Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick the Greek Church and Greek community are essentially one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

much of the attention of the Halifax Council has had to be directed towards
fund raising, first to maintain the older, smaller St. George's, and then to
complete the new building. During Mr. Charles Tsuluhas' long presidency in the
1970s land was purchased for the new church and the community centre was
opened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Lena Blitziotis was the

about thirty-five children, many of them between the ages of three and six.
While it is a joy to teach their religion to the little ones, the teachers at
St. George's expressed some concerns. One teacher said: &quot;It is not a
problem of money, but there are not enough materials for teaching our religion
to very young children who are used to Canadian ways and a Canadian style of
education.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need books which are in
simple language, so the young children can understand what we are talking about
in class. We also need to be more creative in our teaching.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reorganized in the 1930s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition,

helps hold us together.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>GOYA is so
strong in Halifax that it now has divided into two groups according to
age.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The young people of GOYA organize
many social events.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dances are a great
favorite, and are viewed as a way to raise money to help their church and
various local charities. An annual trip outside the province is a new feature
of GOYA life for the Halifax group. When the young people leave GOYA after high
school, many of them will go on to the newly reactivated Hellenic Student
Association which exists for the university student population of Metro.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

about twenty to twenty-five members who come from Dalhousie, <span
class=SpellE>DalTech</span>, Saint Mary's, and Mount Saint Vincent Universities

opportunity for Greek Canadian students to meet and share common interests. The
Hellenic Student Association gets involved in local community projects such as
the donation of blood for medical purposes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>Because Greek dance is one of the
best-known, most colorful aspects of Greek life, and because it is so popular
with the Greek young people in Halifax, St.George's Church recently formed a
Greek Dance Club under the direction of <span class=SpellE>Theofano</span> <span
class=SpellE>Tsirigotis</span> and other teachers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Children learn to do the traditional dances
from many parts of Greece. They learn, for example, the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>tsamikos</b>, which was first danced by the Kleftes or Greek
Revolutionary Warriors who fought against the Turkish rulers in Greece.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This dance is usually done in a circular
fashion with the hands joined.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is led
by each man in turn who, holding a handkerchief or scarf, kicks high in the air
and slaps his shoes as he expresses the dancers' joint wish to fly away from
the earth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only girls dance the <span
class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>sperveri</b></span> which
comes from the island of Rhodes, and is performed the night before a young
couple are to be married.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dance
takes its name from the canopy hanging over the bridal bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the dance the girls cross their arms,
moving in and out, as they pretend to encircle the new marriage bed. The
children in the Halifax dance group perform at nearly all Greek community
functions, and are a particular highlight at the annual Greek Festival. Because
of the popularity of Greek dance, and because they wanted more opportunities to
socialize with their own age group, some young Halifax Greek women from the
ages of sixteen to twenty-six recently asked to form their own Greek dance
class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They, too, are now asked to dance
at community functions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Individual adults in the Greek
community can join two organizations, which stand outside the direction of the
Greek Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those organizations are
AHEPA (American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association) for men, and the
Daughters of Penelope for women.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>AHEPA
began in 1922 in Atlanta, Georgia, as a fraternal association with some Masonic
influences for Greek businessmen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
organization was first formed to fight discrimination and prejudice against
immigrants, but later concerned itself more and more with social, educational,
and benevolent activities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first
Canadian branch opened in Toronto in 1928.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>AHEPA is committed to Greek identity in a North American context with
English as its official language.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
Canada AHEPA strives to promote two cultures, Canadian and Greek, and it
encourages its members to be active participants in the life of their local
communities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus the Nova Scotia branch
of AHEPA raises money for St. Georges in Halifax, gives scholarships to Greek
students who are graduating from high school and going on to university, and
participates in local community projects.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Daughters of Penelope began in the U.S. as an auxiliary of AHEPA in
some of its functions, but at other times the members act on their own
initiative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1999 the Halifax chapter
of the Daughters of Penelope announced a $500 scholarship for a young woman
graduating from high school who wants to pursue post-secondary education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
