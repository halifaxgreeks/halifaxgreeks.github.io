<h1>The New Glasgow and <span class=SpellE>Stellarton</span> Area of <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:place></st1:State></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span></b><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Some Greeks in the New Glasgow/ <span
class=SpellE>Stellarton</span> area of Nova Scotia have roots that go back to
the late nineteenth century.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>John <span
class=SpellE>Spyridakis</span> came to New Glasgow about 1898.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While most of his descendants now live in the
Halifax area, some family members remain in <span class=SpellE>Pictou</span>
County, and most of them now spell the family name as <span class=SpellE><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Sperdakes</b></span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>. </b>A few years ago we interviewed several families from
approximately 140 Greek Canadians in the New Glasgow-Stellarton area of Nova
Scotia. In the following examples, I describe three such families who live in
an area where there are few other Greeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>All these families have become comfortable in a Maritime environment.
Connection with their Greek heritage differs in each case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Members of the <span
class=SpellE>Manos</span> family have lived in New Glasgow since the
1920s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>
family came to New Glasgow from a village near <span class=SpellE>Sparta</span>
in southern Greece, they opened a candy store/ coffee counter with a relative
who was already living in the town. Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Katina</span> <span
class=SpellE>Manos</span> (now deceased) worked at home until her eighties,
rising early each morning to make cakes, cookies, and candies which were sold
later that day in the store. When the <span class=SpellE>Manos</span> family
arrived in Nova Scotia, they had limited financial resources, and there were
only a few other Greek families in the community.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They tried to adjust to the local community,
while at the same time maintaining their Greek identity and traditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>In an interview
conducted in the mid-1980s Mrs. Manos said: “ In the past it was better not to
have close friends, especially in a small Greek community, because the gossip
could get you into trouble.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So you kept
everything inside and you said nothing in order to maintain a quiet life.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In her early life in New Glasgow, looking
after six young children, Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Manos</span> was not as
involved in their family store as much as some of her Greek <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span>:
“My children were my life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A Greek <span
class=SpellE>neighbour</span> of mine had nine children and had to rush back to
the restaurant right after each child was born.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At least I did not have to go out to work.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband, Nick <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>,
was too proud for that, but he did have the children work in the store.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Because the <span
class=SpellE>Manos</span> family was largely cut off by distance from the Greek
church and school in Halifax, they found it very difficult to maintain
traditional Orthodox ties, and to give the children any formal training in the
Greek language.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Manos remembered
one occasion when “… the Greek bishop was travelling through and visited us. He
took one look at a Sunday school certificate, which came from the local
Anglican Church and told my husband off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, my husband was not intimidated by that and said to the bishop,
‘I dare you to ask my children any question on religion, and see if they don’t
know the answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What do you expect me
to do since there is no Greek church here. Let them learn nothing?’ The bishop
had nothing to say to him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>However, in
recent years as travel became easier in Nova Scotia, the <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>
family, and particularly elderly Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>, renewed
ties with the Greek church in Halifax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Mrs. Manos had very fond memories of Rev. Charalambos Elles, who was
priest at St. George’s in Halifax until the mid-1980s.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She confided: “At Easter I send the priest a
big <span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>tsoureki</b></span>
[bread-cake] with <span class=SpellE>coloured</span> eggs on it to bless for me
on Easter Sunday, and he says a special prayer in church for his Greek friends
in New Glasgow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The priest has been very
good to us all these years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He conducted
the funeral service for my husband and we went to Halifax a couple of times for
the <span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>mnemosyno</b></span>
[anniversary] service later.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>In other
interviews two of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>’ daughters, Helen and <span
class=SpellE>Angelina</span> <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>, talked quite
candidly about their lives growing up Greek in this largely non-Greek community.
Helen <span class=SpellE>Manos</span> had come to New Glasgow as a
three-month-old infant, but <span class=SpellE>Angelina</span> <span
class=SpellE>Manos</span> was born in Nova Scotia. <span class=SpellE>Angelina</span>
<span class=SpellE>Manos</span> related that “the only social events when I was
growing up was whenever the Greek ships came to <span class=SpellE>Pictou</span>
<span class=SpellE>Harbour</span> to pick up loads of wood.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Greek crew would invite all of us in the
Greek community on board the ship, and give us a meal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had lots of fun.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have a picture of myself and my sisters on
board one of these ships when we were teenagers.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>Now with the
help of another sister and one brother, Helen and <span class=SpellE>Angelina</span>
run the family store, The London Food and Candy Store, started by their father,
Nick <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>. In accordance with their father’s wishes,
the girls began to work at the family store at an early age. Both women know
only a little spoken Greek. <span class=SpellE>Angelina</span> <span
class=SpellE>Manos</span> said, “It is very unfortunate for me that the Greek
church bulletin does not have much English.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I can’t read the Greek”. Because of the lack of a Greek church in New
Glasgow, they became, and remain members of the Anglican church, although from
time to time they do contribute money to the Greek church in Halifax. Helen and
<span class=SpellE>Angelina</span> <span class=SpellE>Manos</span> are
godmother or <span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>koumbara</b></span>
for their brother Jim’s children, and try to do everything in that role
according to Greek ways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Angelina</span> <span class=SpellE>Manos</span> talked about how
she and her family try to preserve the major Greek holidays, especially Easter.
They also remember the anniversary of their father’s death (and now that of
their mother) with <span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>kolliva</b></span>,
a special mixture of wheat and herbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span><span
class=SpellE>Angelina</span> and Helen spoke of their father with both
affection and exasperation. “ Our father was very good about sponsoring other
Greeks to come to Canada. To us he was demanding and monitored our phone calls
and our friends whom we invited home for dinner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My father was too generous with his
customers, not particularly sensible when it came to the store. He gave
everything on credit and never tried to collect the debts. When we, his
children, took over the store it was in a bad financial shape. Now, however, we
are doing very well.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>In their
forties the <span class=SpellE>Manos</span> sisters finally decided that they
wanted to buy their own place and move out of the family home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their younger brother Jim (now Dr. James <span
class=SpellE>Manos</span> of Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax) gave
them moral support in reaching such a difficult decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen <span class=SpellE>Manos</span> told us
about a high point in her life in 1967, when her brother Jim was visiting in
Greece for a year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Jim, my brother,
made all the arrangements for my sister and myself to fly to Greece. We were
very nervous because up to that point the furthest we had been was Halifax,
when the circus came.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I clearly remember
the outings to Halifax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were not
very many, but we enjoyed them, even though we were loaded with responsibilities
to look after the younger children, because Mum never really wanted to go on a
trip like that. She welcomed the opportunity of having one day’s peace and
quiet without us all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, our visit
to Greece was the one and only time there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We really enjoyed it, and our relatives made us feel very welcome.
Everybody came to see us and we managed very well with our broken Greek.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I regret not going back, but I just don’t
like flying.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Individuals
from the <span class=SpellE>Xiros</span> and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span class=SpellE>Demetre</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>families<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>round out the picture of
Greek<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Canadians in a part of Nova Scotia
which most people probably think of as predominantly Scottish. With the help of
family friend, Nick <span class=SpellE>Manos</span>, Alice and <span
class=SpellE>Haralambos</span> (“Bobby”) <span class=SpellE>Xiros</span> came
from Montreal to Nova Scotia in 1966. They intended to open a pizza parlor with
Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Xiros</span>’ brothers, who had moved to the province
from South America.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before coming to
Canada from their native Greece Mr. and Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Xiros</span>
had spent four years living in London and Paris. At the time of the interviews
in the 1980s Alice and Bobby <span class=SpellE>Xiros</span> had two teenaged
sons at home and an older daughter who was expecting her first baby.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The entire family was living in New
Glasgow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This interview with Mr. and
Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Xiros</span> was conducted in Greek.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE>Xiros</span> family
told our interviewer that they had many Canadian friends and that they enjoyed
Canadian sports such as hockey, baseball, and soccer. They attended St.
George’s Anglican Church in New Glasgow, but they also supported St. George’s
Greek Church in Halifax and were listed as parishioners there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While they spoke to their children in Greek,
traveled with them to Greece, and told them about Greece, they were proud, at
the same time, that their children were very much Canadian. Alice and Bobby <span
class=SpellE>Xiros</span> were very positive about their life in Canada,
complaining only about the cold Canadian winters! </p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Mr. Peter <span
class=SpellE>Demetre</span> of Trenton, Nova Scotia was born in Canada of Greek 
    parents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Married to a non-Greek, he 
    and his family speak only English.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Few 
    of their friends are Greek. They have never traveled to Greece, and their 
    only contact with, for example, Greek food comes when they visit his sisters 
    in Halifax. They do not participate in activities associated with the Greek 
    church in Halifax. In fact, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Demetre</span> said that 
    he would like to see more use of English in the Greek Church and more encouragement 
    for Canadian-born Greeks to study for the priesthood. This would increase 
    the comfort level for the numerous Greek families in which one spouse is non-Greek. 
    Mr. <span class=SpellE>Demetre</span> and his family feel very much part of 
    the Canadian mainstream and regard Nova Scotia as “home”. </p>
