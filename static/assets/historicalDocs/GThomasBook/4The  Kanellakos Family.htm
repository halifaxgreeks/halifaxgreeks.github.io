<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Kanellakos Family
</b><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Mr. Dimitrios
“Jimmy” Kanellakos is the patriarch of one of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>’s best-known Greek families.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His memories go back to World War II and the
subsequent Civil War in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
as well as to Halifax and its Greek community since the 1960s. Recalling the
year 1940, when the Italians were attempting to overrun <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>, he said: “I remember being in the front
line between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Albania</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>, because
this was the direction from which the Italians were coming.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We took cover in an Albanian school, because
the rain was pouring down. I took off all my clothing and put it in a large
stewpot filled with water, so I would not get lice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, after that night I was so cold that
I caught pneumonia.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After World War II
the political situation in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
got even worse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the Civil War
started, I remember that the left-wing fighters were going after the <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>xites</b>, members of an extreme right-wing
faction called ‘the X operation’.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
terrible to see brother fighting against brother.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In our village the xites used to kill our
mules and steal our provisions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On Good
Friday the left-wing faction killed ten people from our village including the
village mayor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was afraid for my life
and for the life of my loved ones, so I would not sleep at night in our house
in case the fighters might attack us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
wife used to throw provisions from the window, and I would go to our orchard
outside the village and spend the night there.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>After living
through those terrible war years, Mr. Kanellakos and his wife finally left for <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the
1960s<span class=GramE>,when</span> new disorders caused the emergence of the
Greek military dictatorship. His adult children were already establishing
themselves in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>.
He continued: “My wife and I came to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> on the ship ‘Fredericka’.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a really bad storm at sea and we
were very frightened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was our first
sea trip, and we did not know what to expect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>On April 9, 1964 we came through Pier 21 in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> to find our four grown-up children
waiting to welcome us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few days later
I saw snow for the first time and it was April! I thought that was a very
strange thing. Generally my early impressions of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> and our life here are very
positive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had come from a village on
the side of <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mount</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Taygetus</st1:PlaceName> in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> and now we had this nice,
first house near the sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>By the time we
arrived in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>
our children were renting a restaurant on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">Agricola Street</st1:address></st1:Street> which sold fish and
chips.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I used to do the cooking with my
partner because I knew no English, and I couldn’t talk to the customers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My two older sons, John and Bill, took care
of the rest of the business. We all worked very hard to transform it into a
success. My wife stayed home with our two youngest children.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After some years my sons found a better
opportunity for a restaurant, so we gave the business on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">Agricola Street</st1:address></st1:Street> to my sister's two sons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In my early years
in Halifax the thing that bothered me the most was the fact that although I
gradually came to understand what people were saying in English, I did not know
enough of the language to answer them properly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At the time the government would pay $150 for immigrants to learn
English, so I asked a friend to come with me to night school where we could
learn together. Unfortunately my friend said ‘no’, and I didn’t want to go by
myself. I regret now that I will never be as comfortable in English as I am in
Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We never forgot
out Greek roots and traditions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have
always gone to the Greek Church in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>
and to all the other gatherings of the Greek people here. I remember how
crowded these gatherings were, and how much fun we had as a community.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As our various family businesses prospered,
and all our children got married with families of their own, we decided to
travel back to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once we went back to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a part
of us wanted to stay there, but our children, and now the grandchildren brought
us back. They have always been determined to make good lives for themselves in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since I do not want to live without them,
this is where I stay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although in the
beginning it was hard and we got homesick, we now agree that our children made
the right choice. Sometimes children are wiser than their parents! Even though
I have my pension, I still like coming into my children’s restaurant, because
that way I get the chance to meet our friends all the time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Unlike most
Greeks who came to the restaurant business in North America with little or no
previous experience, the Kanellakos family already had a background in
restaurant management from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
‘Jimmy’ Kanellakos’ four sons have operated a variety of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> businesses for more than thirty-five
years. Involved in the ownership of other restaurants and stores in former
years, the four Kanellakos brothers, Peter, John, George, and Bill now
concentrate their energies on Cousin’s Restaurant on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">Lady Hammond Road</st1:address></st1:Street>. It is a large-scale
operation which employs twenty-five people, five of whom are family members.
Mr. Peter Kanellakos told the interviewer that their restaurant work “means a
seven day week, with approximately sixty hours of work each week for the family
members.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only days off are for
important holidays like Christmas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every
two or three years we take a two-month vacation.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He went on to say that it was “very hard work
to establish ourselves, but now we are well-known for quality, service, and
good prices.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cousin’s Restaurant offers
both Greek and “Canadian” food to a loyal clientele, many of whom have
patronized the restaurant for years. The long workweeks are difficult, and with
them come high stress levels for the owners who are so actively involved in
every part of the business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Given his
commitment to the business, it is a wonder that Peter Kanellakos has any time
for life beyond the restaurant and his immediate family.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nevertheless, he is a regular supporter of <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">St. George’s</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and a four-time member of the
Church Council.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He and his brothers
always assist the Church at the time of the Greek Festival, and also help the
students with their annual Wine Festival.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>Some of the
third generation members of the Kanellakos family have gone into other
professions such as medicine and teaching. Terry Kanellakos, on the other hand,
who was born in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:place></st1:State>
and has a university degree with a major in Economics, chose to take on the
management of Cousin’s Market with his cousin, John Kanellakos, because, he
said, “I wanted to be my own boss.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like
his Uncle Peter, he accepts the long 50-60 hour workweek, which is necessary
for survival and success in a competitive business environment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the two owner cousins is always at the
store. Cousin’s Market also has two non-family employees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Terry shows great zest for his work and finds
no negative side to it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He particularly
enjoys meeting a wide range of people, and being part of the decision-making
process, which moves the store in the direction that he and his partner want it
to go. Terry remains close to his family, participates in the activities of the
Greek community, and is enthusiastic about any opportunity to travel to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Given so many
years of involvement in a variety of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>
businesses, and in the life of the Greek community, it is not hard to
understand why the Kanellakos name is so well known and respected in the city.</p>
