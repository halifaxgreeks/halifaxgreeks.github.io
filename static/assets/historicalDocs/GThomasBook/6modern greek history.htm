<h1>I. 3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Modern History of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span class=GramE>Greece</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and</span> its Impact on
Emigration</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span></b>Anyone attempting to understand
something of the complexities of Greek/Turkish relations must come to grips
with the deep sense of loss felt for centuries by many Greeks over the fall of
Constantinople, (“The City”- now Istanbul) to the Turks in 1453.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> has faced many wars and
invasions, and over the centuries the population has mixed with Albanians,
Slavs, Turks, and western Europeans. From 1453 onwards a series of foreign
rulers, most often Turks, dominated <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> for over four hundred years.
It was the War of Independence, begun in 1821 against the Ottoman Turks, which
engendered a sense of Greek identity as a united, free people. Independence Day
on March 25th is still an important annual celebration in many Greek Canadian
communities. In <st1:City w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City>, for example, on March
25th the Greek community always arranges to have the national flag of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> hoisted
at the Grand Parade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Even after Greek
independence was formally recognized in 1830, various parts of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> remained
in alien hands. Into the 1920s Greeks were still constantly fighting to regain
territory once held by their ancestors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In part the fighting existed because substantial Greek and Turkish
minorities were present in one another’s countries. As a result of helping the
British and French in <st1:City w:st="on">World War I</st1:City>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> had received a temporary mandate to
occupy part of what they had long called Asia Minor (now western <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Turkey</st1:country-region><span class=GramE>)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and</span> eastern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Thrace</st1:place></st1:country-region>, where Greek people had been
living since before 1000 B.C. However, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
had to abandon these territories in 1921, after she was repulsed by the Turkish
nationalists under Mustafa <span class=SpellE>Kemal</span>, founder of modern <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 tried to end
friction by arranging for an exchange of populations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under this treaty some 400,000 Turks left <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> and over one million Greeks were forced
to leave <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Turkey</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Bitterness caused by that forced expulsion lingers on today, both in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> and in the hearts of Greek emigrant
families, some of whom had come originally from <st1:place w:st="on">Asia Minor</st1:place>.
Quarrels between <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Turkey</st1:country-region> over oil rights in the eastern and
northern Aegean and over the status of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region> have increased tensions
again in the last few years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>From an interview
conducted about ten years ago in <st1:City w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City>, here
is one family’s story about those terrible years of Greek and Turkish fighting
in <st1:place w:st="on">Asia Minor</st1:place>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The following piece is the poignant testimony of an elderly, widowed
Greek woman who is now deceased:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>“My husband was
working at <span class=SpellE>Pontos</span> near <st1:place w:st="on">Constantinople</st1:place>
as an apprentice to a blacksmith.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When
the Turks started killing the Greeks in <st1:place w:st="on">Asia Minor</st1:place>,
he and his brother decided to leave – the rest of their family had already been
burned to death after being locked in a church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Of course it was not easy to escape or to travel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband (he wasn’t my husband then) told
his boss who was a Turk that they needed some horseshoes for the shop.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not suspecting anything, his boss gave him
the money to go and buy some in the city.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This was their opportunity, so they took the money and left.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When they arrived in <st1:place w:st="on">Constantinople</st1:place>,
they worked there for a time until it was possible for them to leave the city
by ship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Actually they had the chance to
go to <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>, but his
brother preferred mainland <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>,
so they came to the <st1:place w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Peloponnese</span></st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had a lot of refugees in our village and
we tried to help them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their only means
of livelihood was carrying wood from the mountains and selling it for food and
clothes. Gradually the Greek government helped them buy some land and establish
themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because he had a hard life,
my husband was always kindhearted to all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Now he is gone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Also crucial to
an understanding of today’s Greek people, whether they be in Greece or in
Canada, is some brief account of the horrors which the Greek population
experienced during World War II and in the years of the Civil War from
1946-49.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>In both World
Wars Greece</span> fought on the side of the western allies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In October 1940 the Italian Fascists under
Mussolini attacked <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
through <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Albania</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In Greek and Greek Canadian hearts October 28<sup>th</sup> is remembered as the
day when <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
said <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Ohi</b></span></span><span
class=GramE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(</span>“No”) to Italian demands to surrender
sections of their country. However, in spite of that brave resistance, the
German Nazis finally overran <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in April 1941 and remained there until October 1944. Through those years <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> suffered
from poverty, disease, and cruelty to its people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many endured punishment and even death trying
to hide members of the allied forces who had slipped into the country to lead
the Greek resistance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Farmlands lay
devastated and lines of communication all over the country were in ruins.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Civil war followed the allied liberation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> had suffered so much during
the war that to some people, Communism seemed an attractive alternative to
poverty. With the backing of the Soviet regime in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> the Greek Communists quietly urged
various guerilla factions to joins Communist cells. Thousands of patriotic
Greeks joined army units whose Communist leadership was not at first apparent.
Other Greeks actively opposed the Communists, and soon Greeks were killing
Greeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Here again are
the words of the same Greek widow, this time speaking about her own experiences
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
during the time of the Nazi occupation and the ensuing Civil War: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“It was during
the German occupation in 1943 that I was walking barefooted from my village to
the city hospital where my boy was being treated for polio.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was passing a German contingent when I
heard shots.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some German soldier was
shooting at the icon of <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Panayia</span></span><span
class=GramE><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>[</span>Mary].<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I made the sign of the cross and called <span
class=SpellE>Panayia’s</span> name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All
of a sudden the soldier dropped dead on the ground.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whether he accidentally shot himself or
someone else shot him, I don’t know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also in the following Civil War, when <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>
turned against <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>, the father of my
daughter-in-law was shot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was a good
man and he had something wrong with one of his arms. Everybody who heard it was
shocked that a physically handicapped man was shot and they all cursed the
killer. Not long afterward the killer was cleaning his gun, when it went off
and shot his arm, making him the same as his victim.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We went through a lot of suffering during the
Civil War.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband, who was never
interested in politics, was taken once and was beaten black and blue.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When they brought him home, I was told that
it was one of my next-door <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span> who had done
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What could I do, a poor woman, to
save the father of my children? I went next door and instead of abusing him, I
begged him to come and have dinner with us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When he came, I offered the best food that I had and he felt
ashamed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That, however, saved my
husband’s life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could not contradict
them, you had to coax them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the
only thing I don’t like about the Greeks- when they turn against each other.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Thus, it is easy
to understand that the years around 1950 were the time when hundreds of Greeks
who could get out, left their beloved homeland to seek new lives abroad,
particularly in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>,
the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>, and <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ongoing poverty in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> and a series of repressive
governments- particularly the harsh regime of the military dictatorship between
1967 and 1974- caused still more Greeks to emigrate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The years of military dictatorship were some
of the worst in <span class=GramE>modern</span> Greek history.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were marked by suppression of human
rights, torture of students and political opponents, administrative corruption,
weak morale in the armed forces, and foolish interference in the government of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In the
summer of 1974 <st1:country-region w:st="on">Turkey</st1:country-region>
reacted to that interference in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and invaded the island.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>War almost broke
out between Greece and Turkey, and the result was (and remains to this time)
the division of Cyprus into two parts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The north remains under the military control of the Turks, while the
Greek south has the only internationally recognized government on Cyprus.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Greece itself, after turmoil and fear of
invasion by the Turks, the military dictatorship or <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>junta</b> finally fell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In July
1974 former President Constantine Karamanlis came back from self imposed exile
and formed a coalition government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>While there have been numerous changes in government since 1974, Greece
is once more a parliamentary democracy with both a prime minister and a
separately elected president.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Greek
people remain passionate about politics, an area which is monitored by a free
and often cynical Greek press.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Slowly Greece’s
economy is improving, with growth occurring primarily in the agricultural,
manufacturing, tourism, and financial sectors. The years of poverty after World
War II are clearly over.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Throughout the
country new buildings have sprung up, a wide variety of consumer goods is
readily available, and children attend school as long as they and their parents
want them to be there. Fine universities exist in places like Athens, <span
class=SpellE>Patras</span>, <span class=SpellE>Joannina</span>, and <span
class=SpellE>Salonika</span>, and there is a new university on the island of
Crete. Many North Americans, both Greek and non-Greek, find modern Greece still
to be a male dominated society, but that is quickly changing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Women in Greece have had the vote only since
1952.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the past the husband was in
effect designated ‘family monarch’ and as such, he possessed the sole and
ultimate right to decide on all household matters, including the right to
direct the <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> of all women in the
household.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A Family Law in 1982
officially changed all of that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>According to this progressive law, all major household decisions are to
be made jointly and children are to be under the care of both parents. The law
officially abolished the dowry. Increasing numbers of women are now working
outside the home and are to be found in all the major professions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Women such as internationally renowned singer
Nana <span class=SpellE>Mouskouri</span>, the late actress and politician
Melina</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Merkouri</span>, politician and former
minister of culture Dora <span class=SpellE>Bakogianni</span>, and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>actress/theatrical
producer Mimi <span class=SpellE>Denissi</span>, are household names in
Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the cities young men and
women date and go around together as they do in North America.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>So many thousands
of tourists visit Greece each year, particularly in the summer, that in many
areas the beautiful stretches of pristine coastline are fast being taken over
by a multitude of hotels, resorts, and restaurants. At the present time, one
major economic problem in Greece is the persistence of a large public service
deficit caused by an inefficient state sector and abuses in the tax and welfare
systems. By 1995 new budgeting systems and grants from the European Union, (of
which Greece is now a member), brought inflation under 10 % for the first time.
Unemployment in certain areas of the country remains another serious problem,
particularly among those with limited education and few job skills.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thousands of Greek migrant workers continue
to live and work in Western Europe, most of them in Germany.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From time to time these men (and almost all
of them are men) return to Greece to try to rebuild their lives, rejoin their
families, and seek employment with some of the skills they have acquired
working abroad. Unfortunately, recent statistics show that many of them return
to unemployment in Greece, or are forced to settle for unskilled or seasonal
jobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The 1998-99 war
in the area of the former Yugoslavia was very painful for Greece; tension about
that conflict remains high. Not only is Greece near the combat zones, but, as a
member of NATO, she is obliged to support NATO’s stand in <span class=SpellE>favour</span>
of the Muslim <span class=SpellE>Kosovars</span> and Ethnic Albanians and
against the Orthodox Christian Serbs. Greeks remember that the Serbs fought
with them in support of the western allies in World War II, while the Albanians
sided with the Germans and Italians.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Thus, many Greeks find the policy of hostility against the Serbs and
support for their opponents both unnatural and distasteful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>During the late
summer of 1999 a terrible earthquake shook Turkey, the worst effects of which
were experienced not far from the ancient city of
Byzantium-Constantinople-Istanbul.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
material damage was enormous, but much more tragic was the fact that thousands
of people were killed, and even more thousands sustained terrible injuries.
Recovery from that disaster will take years, and the human suffering for those
affected will remain for decades. Although Greeks and Turks have often been at
odds with each other over the centuries, when word of the disaster became
known, the response of the Greek government and its people was immediate and
generous. Greece sent money and supplies to the devastated areas, and Greek
people worked shoulder to shoulder with the Turks and other international aid
workers to try and save those trapped in fallen buildings. When another
earthquake hit the Athens area in September 1999, the Turkish people
immediately reciprocated by sending help to Greece. The world’s hope is that
these two countries who have shared recent natural disasters, and been so
