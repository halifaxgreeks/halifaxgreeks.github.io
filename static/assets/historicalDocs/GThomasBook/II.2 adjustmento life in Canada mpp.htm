to Life in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span></b>The early Greek immigrants to the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
tended to be similar in their backgrounds and in the lives they made for
themselves in <st1:place w:st="on">North America</st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were male, usually poor, unskilled and
with low levels of formal schooling, and they had little knowledge of any
language but Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those who had come
from rural, agricultural work in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> mostly entered a variety of
poorly paid manual labor positions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
could be found working in lumbering, in the mines, textiles and other
manufacturing industries, as well as on construction sites, the growing
railways, and the docks of the port cities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even those with a good education and professional training in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> often
had difficulty using these skills in a new country.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, lawyers, doctors, teachers and
other professionals found that their qualifications were not always accepted
outside of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many of them eventually went into business
with family members and friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Earlier immigrants
who had built up Greek restaurants and other small businesses provided jobs for
the newcomers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They often paid low
wages, but these earlier immigrants did provide housing, assist with strange
governmental regulations and local customs, and help with the sponsorship of
the newcomers’ relatives who had been left behind in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In both <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the
United States Greek immigrants experienced some discrimination, especially in
the period between the two World Wars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Many Greeks spoke with heavy, thick accents and non-Greeks found their
long names almost unpronounceable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
difficult were those names for non-Greeks that many Greek families in <st1:place
w:st="on">North America</st1:place> adopted shortened versions of their
original names.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus the name
Makristathis became Mackriss and the name Koutsoyianopoulos became Poulos.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In several parts of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> some
early Greek immigrants were simply known or registered as <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Greek</b>, and that designation stuck as the family name across the
generations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>As still more
Greek immigrants poured into the large American and Canadian cities, <span
class=GramE>they</span> formed “Greek towns”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In essence these were ethnic ghettos where the Greek immigrants spent
the whole of their non-working lives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
they were employed in, or owned one of the Greek restaurants, bakeries or shoe
repair shops, they also spent their working lives in those Greek enclaves
within the larger cities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The heart of
these communities was the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>kafenion</b>,
a replica of the traditional Greek coffeehouse where men of a Greek village
talk and exchange news.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1906 the
Greek immigrant men in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vancouver</st1:place></st1:City>
were said to have had no organized social life except the coffeehouse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Co-existing with the kafenion was the <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>taverna</b> or Greek nightclub.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Live music, dance, and games of chance
provided entertainment there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
favorite Greek instrument called a <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>bouzouki
</b>played traditional songs and melodies in those clubs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Gradually, the
immigrant men married and family life strengthened in <st1:place w:st="on">North
 America</st1:place>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The growing
presence of the Greek Orthodox Church, the various associations tied to it, and
popular causes in the Greek communities took over much more of people’s leisure
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Slowly, the Greek immigrants began
to move comfortably outside <span class=GramE>their<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek</span> enclaves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Greek towns” with their kafenions and tavernas,
their restaurants, bakeries, small shops, businesses, Greek churches, and Greek
newspaper offices continue to exist today in large cities like <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Toronto</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They are lively places to which the annual Greek festivals attract
thousands of visitors, most of them non-Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For the descendants of the Greek immigrants, most of <span class=GramE>whom</span>
now live far away, the “Greek towns” are no longer ghettos, but places where
they can recapture some living aspects of their forefathers’ past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Since the
beginning of Greek immigration to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>- which, as we have seen, was
mostly male- many Greek men have married non-Greek women. The earliest
immigrants were usually poor, and could not afford expensive trips home in
search of Greek wives, nor the costs associated with bringing wives to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>. They
met non-Greek women in their jobs and living places, and they married them. For
many others the attraction of a Greek wife who knew one’s language and culture
was paramount to a feeling of personal comfort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Those who had the financial means traveled to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> to find wives.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During the period from 1950 to 1970 the
situation improved somewhat as 10,771 Greek women entered <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>, usually
for a variety of domestic positions. This was particularly true in <st1:State
w:st="on">Ontario</st1:State> and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Quebec</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most women were single, so they added to the
pool of Greek women available as potential wives for Greek men already in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In time some of those single Greek women
offered to sponsor a husband-to-be from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> in lieu of a dowry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Through friends and relatives in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> some Greek Canadian men arranged for
brides whom they had probably never met to come to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While nowadays most of us regard such
“arranged marriages” as strange and unthinkable, the fact is that many of them
turned out very well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each spouse in the
contract knew what was expected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
worked hard together, they grew together as partners, and they strove to
maintain their Greek identity in a different, often hostile world.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In time they became the heads of strong,
united families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>All large
communities in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have Greek Orthodox Churches.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> now has
seventy-five of these across the country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>While some Greeks do belong to other religions, particularly to the
Roman Catholic Church, most Greeks are Orthodox.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Greek Orthodox Church makes a strong
effort to perpetuate the idea of a spiritual community in which the members of
a Greek community and the congregation are ideally one and the same. In many
places in the Maritimes Provinces that concept is by and large accepted, but that
is not necessarily the case in the larger cities of Toronto, Vancouver, and
Montreal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Surveys done in the Toronto
area around 1970 found that only about 30% of the Greeks there were formal or <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>kinotis</b> members of the various Greek
churches.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Greek Orthodox Church
everywhere has set annual fees for all active parishioners.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The surveys done in the 1970s showed that
many Greeks in the Toronto area said that they had joined a church expressly
for a family baptism or wedding, and that they did not intend to remain
regular, dues paying members.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was
particularly true in the case of low or moderate-income families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>One of the most
striking aspects of Greek life in Canada is the fact that the majority (perhaps
as high as 97% in the Toronto area) of the Greek immigrants came from semi
literate and unskilled backgrounds, and they entered jobs which required few,
if any skills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, by the time of
their retirement these same first-generation Greeks owned their own small
businesses, or had moved into occupations which required considerable
expertise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The restaurant business most
of all was the Greek road to “upward mobility” and “economic achievement”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the early years of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century this particular business did not require much knowledge of English or
French, and there were no formal educational requirement to produce good
quality, basic food.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Operating a
successful restaurant demands long hours and constant hard work, but most
Greeks were, and are, accepting of that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Many Greeks are naturally outgoing and their personalities fit the easy
give and take of a neighbourhood restaurant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The restaurants also provide employment for many members of an extended
Greek family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>During the years
of World War II Greeks from across Canada supported the Allied war effort,
lending special support to the Greek Relief Fund.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That Fund raised large sums of money, and
through the Red Cross went food, clothing, and medical supplies to those
suffering in Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Greek Relief
Fund continued to operate and send help to Greece during the subsequent Civil
War.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the years 1950-74 as Greek
immigration to Canada peaked and then declined, most of the newcomers were busy
arranging their own lives and those of their families.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, Greeks throughout Canada continued
to follow the tumultuous turning of events in Greece.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some supported one group or faction, some
another.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During the military
dictatorship in Greece, which lasted from 1967 until 1974, Andreas Papandreou,
who had been a leading opponent of the regime, lived in Canada and taught
Economics at the University of Toronto.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Greek Canadians everywhere felt drawn to Papandreou’s Panhellenic
Liberation Movement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the fall of
the military dictatorship Papandreou returned to Greece where he became Prime
Minister of the country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Now as we enter
a new century and millennium Canada is home to second and third-generation
Greeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The young people are more
interested in Canadian politics than in Greek politics.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the past Greek Canadians were not actively
involved in Canadian politics, but that is gradually changing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1999 the Toronto area had at least five
men of Greek descent serving as City Council members.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos is currently a Federal
Minister of Parliament (Liberal) from Montreal, and serves as Parliamentary
Secretary for the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. Mr. Jim
Karygiannis is the Federal Liberal Member of Parliament for
Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, while Mr. John Cannis, also a Federal Liberal,
represents the nearby riding of Scarborough Central.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several Greek Canadians sit or have sat in
provincial legislatures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, in
1999 Dr. Marie Bountrogianni was elected to the Ontario Legislature as a
Liberal representative for the riding of Hamilton Mountain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1998 provincial election in Nova
Scotia Mr. Peter Delefes became the elected New Democratic Party member for
Halifax Citadel, but in the change to a Progressive Conservative government in
the July 1999 voting, he lost the seat.. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The second and third-generation Greek
Canadians are increasingly well educated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>While their parents and grandparents may continue to feel that they are
more <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Greek </b>than <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Canadian</b>, the younger people are comfortable being both Greek <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>and </b>Canadian. Through their parents and
grandparents’ hard work and their own diligent efforts many are now active
professional and business people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
have moved into education, law, medicine, engineering and a variety of other
fields.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many of them own well
established, flourishing businesses, some of which have been in their families
for years. Construction and real estate projects seem particularly attractive,
as some individuals and families let go of the restaurants and stores of the
past.<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> </b>Of course, many Greek Canadians
continue to own small or midsize restaurants as well as other traditional
stores and service-oriented outlets. They are nearly always well run, and they
provide personal, quality service.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
work ethic exemplified by the early Greek immigrants to Canada is everywhere
alive and well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></p>
