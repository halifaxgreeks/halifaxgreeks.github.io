<h1>V.2<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span><span class=GramE>The</span>
Post Education Generation</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span></b>Late in 1999 we conducted about
fifteen interviews with young adults in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> area who had finished their education
and started careers and homes for themselves. They ranged in age <span
class=GramE>between twenty-five to forty</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several individuals were very involved with
the Greek community, while others had little or no involvement. Travel to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> was
either a future plan or a frequent event in their lives. Almost all identified
themselves as “Greek Canadian” and spoke fondly about their Greek backgrounds.
As individuals they said that they had no intention of being assimilated
completely into the larger Canadian society, although they felt very much a
part of that society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City> through the interviews, the author
was struck by certain reoccurring patterns and remarks. All of the people
interviewed had completed high school, and most had gone on to some sort of
post-secondary education.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several had
two or more university degrees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In many
cases the young adults were moving away from the traditional restaurants and
diners into skilled trades and professions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For example, in 1999 Julia <span class=SpellE>Tsuros</span>, who has a
degree in Early Childhood Education, opened her own Infant Centre because, “I
love children and I thought I would try it as a career.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now I know that I love what I am doing for a
living.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Others were helping to turn the
traditional, small family businesses into large, complex operations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ship Shape Laundry and Dry Cleaning is a good
example of a longtime family business that has expanded tremendously in recent
years under the direction of the younger members of the <span class=SpellE>Xidos</span>
family. Started in the 1960s by Nick and Antonia <span class=SpellE>Xidos</span>,
most of the operation today is directed by their two sons, Dino and Mike, and
by their daughter, Cathy <span class=SpellE>Mavrogiannis</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ship Shape now has a fleet of six <span
class=GramE>vans,</span> it collects dry cleaning and laundry from all over the
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Halifax</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Regional</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Municipality</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
and has numerous large government and university contracts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>As a group the
younger Greeks are marrying later than their parents, although <span
class=GramE>almost<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>all</span> said they
would like to be married at some point and have their own families. They lead
very busy lives, juggling careers, families, church, and leisure time
activities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To <span class=GramE>illustrate</span>
that point we look briefly here at three individuals from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City></st1:place> whose lives contain all those
elements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are Maria <span
class=SpellE>Alexiadis</span>, Costa <span class=SpellE>Elles</span>, and
Joanna <span class=SpellE>Kanellakos</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Dr. Maria <span
class=SpellE>Alexiadis</span> is a family physician in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>. She enjoys sports such <span
class=GramE>as<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>soccer</span>, kayaking,
and hiking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like her whole family before
her, Maria is extremely involved in the Halifax Greek community where, in
addition to her duties as the newly elected president on the Council, she is a
member of the church choir, and organizing committee of the Greek
Festival.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was an editor of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. George’s</st1:place></st1:City> 1985 Year
Book<span class=GramE>, <u><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></u>and</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>served as an advisor to the church youth
group, GOYA. She is the local representative on the Diocesan Church Council for
the whole Canadian Orthodox Church. Dr. <span class=SpellE>Alexiadis</span> has
done several medical lectures for the Greek community in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>, and is frequently asked to do radio
and television interviews about Greek traditions for Christmas and Easter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Costa <span
class=SpellE>Elles</span> is a son of a former priest at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">St. George’s</st1:place></st1:City>, Rev. Charalambos Elles. He is a
marketing sales executive and graduate of Saint Mary’s University who has often
been an invited guest speaker for university gatherings, especially those
involving career planning for students.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Costa has always been personally active in sports.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is presently a member of the executive of
Squash Nova Scotia. He is also on the executive of the Nova Scotia Soccer
Association that oversees soccer programs for adults and children all over the
province. Costa said that as a vice-president of the Greek community he attends
all functions of the community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“I am
involved with everything there. The generation before us worked very hard in
order for us to have our Greek Church and hall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Therefore I am very grateful for all they have offered to us, and I feel
that it is my time now to offer something back to the Greek community.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Joanna <span
class=SpellE>Kanellakos</span>, whose family is profiled in Chapter VI of this
book, is a <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>
schoolteacher. Like Maria and Costa, Joanna is active in sports, particularly
in running, power walking, and step aerobics.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She hopes to upgrade her teaching license and possibly take a Master’s
Degree.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For years she has helped with
the Greek Festival as a member of the steering committee, in advertising the
Festival, and as a multifaceted worker on the actual days of the Festival.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is a Sunday schoolteacher and an advisor
for various youth groups in the Greek Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Not all those
interviewed are, or wanted to be, as involved in the Greek community as Maria
Alexiadis, Costa Elles, and Joanna <span class=SpellE>Kanellakos</span>. Some
explained that distance as a personal need to move forward in their careers or
to look after young children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two or
three made this sort of remark:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“At this
point I do not participate much in the Greek community because the older
generation does not accept our ideas easily.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Perhaps I’ll be more involved when our children are older.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>These young
adults were asked to identify the positive features they felt in being part of
the Halifax Greek community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were
also asked to comment upon challenges for the community’s future. Andreas <span
class=SpellE>Gavas</span> said: “I’m very proud to have such a strong cultural
background.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has helped me find out
who I am, and how I should measure success in life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My family is so important to me, because they
understand me and help me understand what it means to be Greek Canadian.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Almost all these
young adults mentioned with concern the number of educated young Greeks who are
leaving the region to find employment and greater opportunities elsewhere.
Several thought that more marriages to non-Greeks would produce a next
generation who are more “<span class=SpellE>Canadianized</span>” and less
Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several people in the interviews
said, “We are in a period of transition.” Maria <span class=SpellE>Alexiadis</span>
commented, “We want to get younger people involved but it is difficult because
of the struggle of old and new ideas. Sometimes the younger Greeks feel
frustrated because they think that the older generation will not let them take
charge.” Mariana <span class=SpellE>Veletas</span> worried because, “We are not
as tight a community as we used to be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>On the positive side I feel we have become more open to “English” <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Most of these 
    younger Greeks wanted to thank their parents’ and grandparents’ generation 
    who had worked so hard to acquire security and a good standard of living for 
    all of them. Now, they said, they would like to see members of the community 
    put less emphasis on material values and the intense competition which so 
    often still characterizes Canadian Greek life. It seemed to the author that 
    Joanna <span
class=SpellE>Kanellakos</span> clearly summarized the views of many of her generation: 
    “Growing up as a young person who was part of two communities, the Greek and 
    the wider Canadian community, made for a very busy life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had to participate equally in both Canadian 
    and Greek functions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But looking back 
    now, I do not regret that kind of life style because I got the opportunity 
    to learn about my Greek background and culture, and maintain my Greek identity, 
    while also being a Canadian.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span></p>
