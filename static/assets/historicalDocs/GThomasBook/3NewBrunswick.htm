<h1>The Greek Community in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  Brunswick</st1:place></st1:State></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>While people of
Greek descent do live in other parts of <st1:State w:st="on">New Brunswick</st1:State>,
particularly in the cities of <st1:City w:st="on">Fredericton</st1:City> and <st1:City
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Moncton</span></st1:City>, the largest Greek
community in the province is in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint
  John</st1:place></st1:City>. A picture of Greek Canadian life in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City> about 1950
reveals the usual pattern of small stores, cafes, and restaurants. For many
years Michael Marcus (<span class=SpellE>Mercuriou</span>) was called the “Old
Man” of the Greeks in the city, for he had arrived there in 1905.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was also known as “Dr. <span class=SpellE>Asclepios</span>”
[<span class=SpellE>Asclepios</span> is the Greek god of medicine] because of
his knowledge and skill with herbs. Mr. Marcus was the long-time president of
the Greek Orthodox community in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint
  John</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Other Greek names
from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City>
in the mid twentieth century include Harry Stevenson <span class=GramE>( <span
class=SpellE>Charalambos</span></span> <span class=SpellE>Stavrakos</span>),
George Stevenson, and Peter Pappas who were co-owners of the Riviera Restaurant
on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Charlotte Street</st1:address></st1:Street>.
Although Harry Stevenson had been a lawyer in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>,
when he arrived in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City>
in 1926, he left law behind him. Harry Stevenson was the principal force in
organizing <st1:State w:st="on">New Brunswick</st1:State>’s help to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> during
the time of World War II and the subsequent Civil War. He was chair of the
local chapter of the Greek War Relief Fund, as well as liaison officer between
the headquarters of that Fund in <st1:City w:st="on">Montreal</st1:City> and
the Swedish boats sailing from the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">port</st1:PlaceType>
of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Saint John</st1:PlaceName> with relief supplies for
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></b>The
author was very pleased when Mr. George <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span>, one
of the oldest, if not the oldest, member of the Greek community in <st1:City
w:st="on">Saint John</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  Brunswick</st1:place></st1:State> agreed to an interview.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span>’ life
is both interesting in itself, and illustrative of the success Greek people in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Brunswick</st1:place></st1:State> have made
of their lives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>George <span
class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> was one of the founding members of St. Nicholas
Greek Orthodox’ Church in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City>
in the 1950s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other Greek Canadians in
the city always say, “Ask George, he knows everything about our community.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Like many Nova <span
class=SpellE>Scotian</span> Greeks, George <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span>’
home is in <span class=SpellE>Xerocampi</span> in the southern <st1:place
w:st="on"><span class=SpellE>Peloponnese</span></st1:place>. He had been
studying law at the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Athens</st1:PlaceName> in the 1940s, but decided to leave <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> late in
1946, because he felt in was no longer safe for <span class=GramE>him</span> to
stay in the country. Leaving <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
in a hurry, he went on a vessel which first sailed to a Black Sea port in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>, before crossing the Atlantic to <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Baltimore</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Maryland</st1:State></st1:place>.
After a brief stay in the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>,
his Uncle Harry Stevenson in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Bangor</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Maine</st1:State></st1:place> picked up young George. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>George <span
class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> spent his initial months in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> studying
English with a retired teacher. He had intended to go on with his interrupted
legal studies, but when his cousin, George Stevenson, died in 1948, he was
needed to help run the Riviera Restaurant. After a time at a business college,
he became manager of the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Riviera</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1949, and a partner in the business in 1953.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He also operated the Reversing Falls Restaurant (a May to September
operation) for thirty-eight years, and the dining room of the White House Lodge
between 1965 and 1975. In the 1950s George <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span>
brought several Greeks to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
to work in the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Riviera</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They progressed from dishwashers to cooks,
and then went on to open their own businesses, often other restaurants. Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> was active in the Restaurant Association of <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Brunswick</st1:place></st1:State>, and
served as president of that Association for several years.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was also a vice-president and a national
director of the Canadian Restaurant Association.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>From the early
years of his life in Canada George <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> made St.
Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church a major part of his life. To build the church
the Greek community in <st1:City w:st="on">Saint <span class=GramE>John</span></st1:City><span
class=GramE><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>raised</span> money locally
in <st1:State w:st="on">New Brunswick</st1:State>, and from friends and
relatives in the Greek communities of <st1:City w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City>
and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montreal</st1:place></st1:City>.
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> said, “Although this is the smallest
Greek Orthodox community in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
we have our own church and a house for our priest. We are self-supporting. Why
is the community here so successful? In the old days it was so difficult to
exercise our religion and the people wanted their own church. Although there
were only about forty Greek people, including the kids, when I arrived in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City>, we all worked
together. The Canadian people knew the Greeks- they had a very good record in
business-and they helped with donations of money and materials. From the beginning
people treated us like Canadians.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Although he
retired in 1994, George <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> maintains a busy
life. He travels to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
every year to visit with a good friend from his boyhood years. Never married
himself, he is very proud of his nephews, his niece, and their families. One
nephew, Dino Pappas, is a senior lawyer in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City>, and one of his sons is a lawyer.
So the family’s interest in law goes on to the next generations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> is concerned about the future of the Greek
language in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Brunswick</st1:place></st1:State>.
“It’s important to have a priest who speaks both Greek and English. The
priest’s English can bring people in, and then we give them Greek in the
church.” George <span class=SpellE>Maniatis</span> still serves on the Church
Council at St. Nicholas. “I am so pleased that our younger men are going on the
Council and being active there. I am always available if anyone wants advice or
help.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>John <span
class=SpellE>Likourgiotis</span> is one of those young men who have been
elected to St. Nicholas Church Council. Born in <st1:City w:st="on">Saint John</st1:City>,
he and his family recently returned to the city, after his successful career
with Northern Telecom in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Toronto</st1:place></st1:City>.
John and his wife brought their children to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City> because they wanted a warm, family
environment around them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the
interview John said: “Greek families are very close; the family is probably the
centre of each person.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Speaking about
being both Canadian and Greek, John said: “The idea of a Canadian identity is
very important to me. I’m Canadian first and foremost. This country has been
good to my family and me. I look at myself as a Canadian with a Greek heart. It
means I fit into this society. But I do so carrying some baggage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have certain values and expectations which
are uniquely Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most Greeks
immigrated to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
because they were motivated to succeed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The drive which brought them here has propelled them to excel in
business, or whatever they do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
been passed on to the next generation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>There is a lot of pressure to make sure that we are seen as contributing
to the Canadian community.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>John went on:
“It’s hard to maintain the Greek language. I was in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Toronto</st1:place></st1:City> for ten years, and had few contacts
with the Greeks there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a little
better here- I speak Greek daily with my dad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The church is very important. It is the place, which keeps the community
together, where we and the children interact with others who value the Greek
spirit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is the basis of maintaining
our Greek culture.” John <span class=SpellE>Likourgiotis</span> regularly
attends St. Nicholas Church, even though he has to work every second Sunday. He
is married to a non-Greek who is a Roman Catholic, and the couple also
participates in the life of that church.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>While he is personally 
    committed to promoting the Greek community in any way he can, John <span
class=SpellE>Likourgiotis</span> has some concerns for its future,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“There aren’t a lot of young people in our community; 
    many have moved away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hopefully we 
    can grow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If people are indifferent, 
    and do not participate actively in the Greek Church and community, we will 
    not survive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The church will have to 
    increase its use of English.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can maintain our Greek values in English and 
    pass them along to my family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our children 
    know some Greek words, and they have started to go to Greek School, but they 
    will never be fluent in Greek. Somehow we must preserve the Greek values and 
    the Greek community here, even if that means the use of the Greek language 
    will probably diminish.”</p>
