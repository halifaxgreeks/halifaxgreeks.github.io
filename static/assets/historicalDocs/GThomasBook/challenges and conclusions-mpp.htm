<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span></b><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>It is clear that Greek people in the <st1:State
w:st="on">Maritime Provinces</st1:State> have adapted well to a new country,
and have prospered in <st1:place w:st="on">Eastern Canada</st1:place>. In
earlier years many of them came from terrible conditions caused by war and
poverty in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
their diligence and their willingness to work at time consuming, often
exhausting jobs have created good lives for themselves and their children. In
many Maritime households we now find second and third-generation Greek people
who were born in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and who live in cities and towns to which their parents and grandparents came
years before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So they are well
established and comfortable in their lives, but their favorite designation for
themselves, even among many young people, tends to be “Greek Canadian”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>The lives of
the Greek Canadians in the Maritimes differ very much according to the
provinces in which they reside, and even the area of the province where they
live.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no Greek community on <st1:State
w:st="on">Prince Edward Island</st1:State>, and those Greek people living on
the <st1:place w:st="on">Island</st1:place> whom we were able to identify and
interview prefer to blend with the local non-Greek population.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They maintain a Greek identity in their
private lives by visits to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
and their contacts there or in other parts of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> where there are large Greek
populations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State w:st="on">New
 Brunswick</st1:State> the nucleus of a Greek community exists in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City> around St.
Nicholas Church. The older people know one another very well, but the younger
people live their lives largely in a non-Greek world. In regions beyond <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Saint <span class=GramE>John</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=GramE><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it</span> is only possible
for the outsider to identify Greek Canadians by looking for local restaurants
with an obvious Greek flavor, or by occasional, chance contacts. Greek
Canadians in other parts of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  Brunswick</st1:place></st1:State> regard St. Nicholas’ Church as both their
spiritual and their community centre.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They visit it and their Greek friends in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Saint John</st1:place></st1:City> as frequently as possible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:State>
has a relatively large Greek population with most Greek people living in <st1:City
w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City> and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. The Halifax Greek
people are well established and well respected by the non-Greek population.
Cape Breton Greeks have a long, proud tradition centered on Ss. Anargyroi’s
Church. The difficulties for the Cape Breton Greek <span class=GramE>community
are</span> largely those of wider <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName>, where chronic unemployment
causes many young <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bretoners</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> to leave home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>Even in the
relatively large Greek community in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>
area the people are facing choices and decisions which will affect their future
and change the community. Many Halifax Greeks would certainly prefer to
maintain the status quo, and look askance at possible changes. The work and
expense which went into the new <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St.
  George’s</st1:place></st1:City> has resulted in a beautiful, well appointed
building containing both a traditional Byzantine church and all the facilities
for a well used community centre. Expenses to maintain that building are on
going, and push the congregation to focus on the church property and sometimes
ignore other, more complex issues. Mr. Takis Kostopoulos, former head of the
annual Greek Festival, recently queried whether the nature of the Festival in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> might change from
its major emphasis on food and entertainment to something, which could offer
the wider non-Greek community a more in-depth look at Greek culture.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said, &quot;Why not, for example, <span
class=GramE>have a whole week</span> of activities when each day is dedicated
to one aspect of our heritage?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One day
we could concentrate on Greek cuisine, another on history and art etc.” But
this would mean tampering with a very successful and very lucrative fund
raising activity for the church, and naturally some church people worry about
those implications. When Mr. Steve <span class=SpellE>Giannoulis</span>,
President of the Church Council from 1993-1996, raised the idea of establishing
a Greek nursing home, or at least providing Greek speaking staff and familiar
Greek food within one of the existing nursing homes in the Halifax area, his
idea was not taken up by the Council. Greek tradition has always taught that
family members provide total care for one another’s needs. That premise rests
on the reality that there are family members, usually women, who are at home to
provide twenty-four hour care when it is needed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today most active Greek Canadian women are
either occupied with their young children or have busy careers outside the
home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many fortunate Greek seniors do
reside with family members. That gives them security, and they, in turn, often
play a major role in running the household while other family members are away
from the home. However, that optimal situation is not always possible,
especially when intense, full time nursing care is required. Some Greek seniors
now live comfortably in local nursing homes, but their Greek families are aware
that, in spite of all their efforts at visiting, in large part their loved ones
are cut off for most of the time from their language and culture.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Larger Greek communities in <st1:City w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City>
and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montreal</st1:place></st1:City>
have gone some way to provide special care facilities with a Greek atmosphere
for those who want and need them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>Greek
language and cultural education are other areas for real concern.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even given the general desire to see the
Greek language flourish among young people of Hellenic descent in Atlantic
Canada, the various Greek communities will have to decide how much increasing
effort, time, and money they are willing to put into Greek language
education.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a period when there are
more and more marriages between Greeks and non-Greeks, English is likely to be the
dominant language in those homes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek
schools, as Callie <span class=SpellE>Iatrou</span> points out, cannot do the
whole job of teaching the Greek language to their children.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then too, not all adults married to Greeks
can, or are willing, to put the immense effort into acquiring reasonable
fluency in an admittedly difficult language. While some individuals are
prepared, even eager to promote their Greek spouses’ rich heritage, one must
ask whether they will continue to be comfortable in an environment of church
and community where they do not understand much of what is being said and
written.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What will be the consequences
for the continuation of the Greek language in the Maritimes? How much will
Greek churches be willing to increase the use of English in the regular church services
in order to accommodate those <span class=GramE>whose</span> Greek is weak or
non-existent?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>The author
thinks that the most crucial area for Maritime Greeks is the decisions which
the young people will make about their continued involvement with the Greek
communities, and the values which they want those communities to preserve.
Younger people on the brink of taking over the leadership in the older Greek
communities are bringing along new ideas about the development and future of
those communities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we have seen, the
young Greek Canadians are marrying non-Greeks in increasing numbers. Many of
them have thought carefully about what this means for themselves, their
families, and the whole Greek community. If they marry in the Orthodox Church
and have willing spouses who are interested in Greek culture, they are actually
expanding the base of the Greek community in the Maritimes. This has been the
experience in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> where, instead of fearing marriages
to non-Greeks, the Greek people increasingly see such marriages as a positive
feature for the future. They bring new blood, new ideas, and enthusiastic
converts into the Greek fold.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this
regard Rev. Theodore Efthimiadis of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>
has done much to calm the worries of older Greeks who used to fear potential
marriages between their children and the non-Greek population. However, a
marriage conducted outside the Greek Orthodox Church between an Orthodox
Christian and another non-Orthodox person means that the sacraments of the
church and leadership in church organizations are forbidden to an individual
who was brought up in the Orthodox faith. Thus formerly active members of the
Greek Church and community can be lost. In areas, especially outside <st1:City
w:st="on">Halifax</st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on">Saint John</st1:City>, and <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cape</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Breton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,
where Orthodox churches do not exist, marriages between Greeks and non-Greeks
almost certainly will mean the eventual weakening of the Greek ties and the
sense of Greek identity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>In an
overwhelming number of interviews with young Greek Canadians they said that
they want to remain both Greek and Canadian, they want to remain Orthodox, but
they expect to have their voices heard, their needs met, and they predict that
changes will take place, even changes within the church.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They do not necessarily accept direction from
the older members of the community, simply because they are older and now
occupy places of authority within the community.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After all the young people have been educated
in Canadian schools where they have been taught to think for themselves, and to
take on value systems which may be radically different from those of their
parents and grandparents. Over and over again young individuals told our
interviewers that their parents had left <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
in the 1950s and brought with them the standards and values of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> at that
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But those are not today’s patterns
of <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> either in Canada or modern Greece, and
the young people who have visited Greece so often, resent the fact that they
are being asked to live in a sort of artificial time bubble. Interviews done
about ten years ago with young, second-generation Greek Australians recorded
the same complaints.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Young Maritime
Greeks would like to see a greater variety of youth centered activities. They
note that very few young people, even in their thirties and forties, have been
elected to the important Church Council.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Some have suggested that trained Greek Canadian counselors should be at
hand when sensitive topics such as parental authority, couples living together
without marriage, and changing attitudes to women need to be addressed. While
we need to give voice to these issues which have been raised by young Greek
Maritimers, at the same time we should acknowledge that some young Greek
Canadians have been willing to speak in interviews to those whom they regard as
sympathetic listeners, but they are often unwilling, and slightly afraid to
voice those same ideas publicly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
would mean possible confrontation with well-established power structures in the
church and community. Then, too, the young people do not want to hurt older
members of the community whom they have loved and admired for so long, even
though they would like to begin a dialogue about subjects that are often
difficult for their elders to hear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>In spite of
the challenges facing Greek Canadians in the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Maritime Provinces</st1:place></st1:State>, as a people their lives
exemplify many very positive and attractive qualities. For the author, herself
a non-Greek, those positive features in Greek Canadian life have always been
very apparent, and indeed, are the reason she initially agreed to undertake
this study.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At a time when we are seeing
divorce rates in <st1:place w:st="on">North America</st1:place> approaching
50%, divorce among Greeks on this continent remains a rarity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In general Greek Canadians commit fully to
marriage and to one another as partners for life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They raise their children to regard the
family as <u>the</u> most important unit in society, and family members as
their most important friends, loves, and allies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This came home to the author most recently
when she was invited to a large house party, mostly attended by Greek Canadians,
but with a handful of non-Greeks also present.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The occasion was a happy one for <span class=GramE>this</span> family-
two university graduations, a name day celebration, and a birthday.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the favorite Greek foods spread over the
dining room table and were replenished over and over again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A full size lamb, which had been roasting all
afternoon on the outside grill, was the dinner’s main dish.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of all I noticed the affection
constantly being displayed among the extended family members, old and young,
male and female. They gave each other spontaneous hugs and kisses with no sense
of self-consciousness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grandparents
had just returned from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and all the grandchildren delighted in their presence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I came away thinking how blessed this family
is for the warmth and affection they all share – and I recognized that each
family member makes a strong effort to foster that sense of collective unity
and support.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are all people with
individual lives and careers, but the warmth they have as a family reaches out
to embrace not only each other, but also those guests and friends who are
fortunate enough to be invited into their circle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>In addition to
the strong commitment to family, most Greek Canadians in the Maritimes are
notable for the way they identify Greek <span class=GramE>church</span> and
Greek community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are very willing
to give generously of their time, efforts, and money to support the Orthodox
churches here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even people from outside
the Metropolitan areas send financial support for the Greek churches. Over and
over again in the interview we heard “to be Greek means to be Orthodox.” While
there are always some exceptions to a general rule, Greeks in the Maritimes who
are not Orthodox often socialize with other Greek Canadians, but they seem to
stand apart from the Greek communities which are so identified with the
churches.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other areas such as <st1:City
w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vancouver</st1:place></st1:City>
there are Greek communities distinct from the life of the Orthodox churches.
This is not the case in the Maritimes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is not only for purpose of identification with the Greek community <span
class=GramE>that<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>many</span> Greek
Canadians continue in their Orthodox faith. An outsider, who admires the beauty
of the Byzantine style churches and enjoys occasional participation in the
elaborate, almost mystic church liturgies, can miss the deep spirituality which
for many Greek Orthodox is the essence of their religion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a devout Greek Orthodox Christian their
living faith which traces its roots back to apostolic times is an unshakable,
permanent rock in an otherwise impermanent world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>No one can
help admiring the strong work ethics of most Maritime Greeks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In their attitudes to hard work Greek
Canadians are like so many other immigrant peoples who take on any task,
however onerous, in order to build good lives for themselves and their
families.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have never heard the slur
that Greeks take jobs away from other Canadians.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Indeed, their hard work and their strong
business sense have allowed them to develop all sorts of prosperous business
operations, which often employ large numbers of non-Greeks. </p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>As a Classics 
    professor in Halifax I cannot help being partial to a people who represent 
    a living link with the history of ancient Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>I first met many of the Halifax Greeks years ago when I was invited 
    by Father Charalambos Elles to give some talks on a few aspects of ancient 
    Greek art, history, and literature in St. George’s Community Centre.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Father Elles was concerned that his parishioners 
    should learn something about the achievements of their famous ancestors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>In those afternoon sessions I soon discovered how much the local Greek 
    people already knew about their history, and how eager they were to share 
    their cultural heritage with others. As I got to know them better, I came 
    to understand that the Greeks in Canada, and especially in the Maritimes, 
    were themselves making contributions to Canadian life in ways that enrich 
    us all. I have gained a deep respect for them and a sense of gratitude that 
    they would allow me, as an individual from outside their community, to examine 
    their lives, however briefly, and endeavor to say something about them to 
    a wider audience. To be put under some sort of public microscope is not easy 
    for the subjects, but I hope that the results have been somehow rewarding.
