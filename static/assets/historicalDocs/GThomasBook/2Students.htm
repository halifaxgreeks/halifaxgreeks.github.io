<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>Young Greek Canadians have led very
different lives from their parents and grandparents who first came to this
country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In general they are better
educated than their elders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They usually
have had relatively comfortable lives enriched by a solid home, good schooling,
plentiful leisure time, and frequent travel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>They have certainly never known the horrors of war, the lack of food,
and the poverty which drove the older generations out of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Given all the benefits that the younger Greek
Canadians enjoy, they also face difficulties and personal stresses, which were
not characteristic of an earlier time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At the beginning of a new millennium the employment picture in Atlantic
Canada offers only limited opportunities to all young people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many who want good jobs-Greeks and non-Greeks
alike-must <span class=GramE>leave</span> and go to other provinces and bigger
cities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a reversal of the voyage
which brought the earlier Greeks to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>,
some young Greek Canadians now have gone to work, marry, and establish homes in
a newly prosperous <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those young Greeks who remain in the
Maritimes struggle with something of an identity crisis.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When asked about their identity, they tend to
answer, &quot;I am Greek&quot; or &quot;Greek Canadian.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although born in this country, when they
speak of &quot;Canadians&quot;, they obviously mean the wider, non-Greek
community in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which they see as somewhat different from themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>            </span>It is impossible to interview all
the individuals to whom one would like to talk, but recently (1996-99) the
author managed to conduct about forty interviews with young Greek Canadians in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nova Scotia</st1:place></st1:State> between the
ages of fifteen and twenty-five.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this
<span class=GramE>group</span> most of those interviewed lived at home with
their parents, or were away at university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Most were born and had lived all of their lives in <st1:State w:st="on">Nova
 Scotia</st1:State>, but two of the young men who were brothers had lived for
several years in the Middle East and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region> with their parents, and
attended elementary school there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
young woman in the group had also lived and attended school in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Several
students had parents one of whom is Greek, and one <span class=GramE>is</span>
not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In our interview group one student
is a third-generation Greek whose father and mother, both of Greek descent,
were also born in the Maritimes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the
others had at least one parent who was born in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most had close family members living in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:country-region>
whom they had seen either when they and <span class=GramE>their<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>families</span> visited there, or when their
family members came to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to see them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of the students had
been to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
many times to visit family there, while others had only been once or
twice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With instruction in the Greek
language at home and in Greek school, most of them were reasonably fluent in
Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of these students had close
relatives living in Atlantic Canada, and several of them had Greek cousins
living within one or two streets of their homes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As a group they tended to be very
close to their families.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The younger
ones in particular spent considerable time with their families, went out
socially with them, and participated in family activities, often centered <span
class=GramE>around</span> the Greek Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Now in her twenties and looking back at her own childhood, <span
class=SpellE>Niki</span> <span class=SpellE>Fasoulis</span> remarked: <span
class=GramE>&quot; I</span> always grew up with other young Greeks, because my
parents knew their parents and it was safe to do things together. I was allowed
to go to their homes and sleep there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
tried to please the Greeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted to
be accepted.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fifteen-year-old
Stella Athanasiou said that she and her mother talked all the time, and that
her mother was very concerned that they communicate freely as mother and
daughter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said that although there
were constant conversations between her mother and herself, she knew that her
father must be consulted for any important decision affecting his daughter.
Stella's grandmother lived with the family, and her granddaughter relished all
the special Greek food her grandmother prepared for them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seventeen year-old Angie <span class=SpellE>Lozos</span>
said that her father constantly reminded everyone that they had to guard and
protect their family's good reputation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Angie herself remembered how much she enjoyed helping her late mother
with all her work as president of the <span class=SpellE>Philoptochos</span>
Society. Angie looked forward to following in her mother's footsteps in her own
future involvement with the Philoptochos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>Since education was so much a part of
the group's current focus, it was worthwhile spending some time considering
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Half of the students were still in
high school at the time of the interviews, while the rest were in, or had just
finished with university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Three of the
students interviewed were in universities outside the Maritimes in <st1:City
w:st="on">Montreal</st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on">Toronto</st1:City>, and <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Hampshire</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several students thought that they would do
graduate work, probably in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but possibly outside this country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
wanted to attend graduate school in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and several were in
graduate or professional programs in a Maritime university at the time of the
interview.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>The students were asked to evaluate the
education they had received in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>,
and were asked whether they could compare it with education in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most expressed general satisfaction with
their Canadian education, but they said that from personal experience and from
reports of family and friends, they thought that school programs in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region> were easier than those in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and
that there was less heavy grounding here in basic subjects such as math.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of the students were able to make
critical judgements of the educational systems in both countries.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stacey <span class=SpellE>Karteroulis</span>,
for example, said that she preferred her education in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region> at the elementary and high school levels
because they studied a broader range (that is, more) subjects in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> than in
the Canadian schools.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, when it
came time to attend university, Stacey preferred to come to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City>, where she attended Saint Mary’s
University while living with close relatives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Expressed in different ways, the following sort of remark which came
from Tina Piper was fairly common.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Canadian education is a social experience. Greek education is a
didactic experience…In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
education is very book-dependent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> it's
much easier.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek teachers are not
approachable.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several of the
others who were interviewed contrasted that difference between the friendly,
approachable Canadian teachers and the rather aloof, distant teachers they had
heard about or studied with in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On another point, fifteen year old Evan
Boukistianos, one of the brothers who had spent time living in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:country-region> said, <span class=GramE>&quot; My</span>
friends in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:place></st1:country-region>
spend more time studying languages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
terms of second languages they know more English than we learn
French.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Perhaps because they had
lived all their lives with two languages, English and Greek, some students were
interested in the acquisition of still other languages, and told us that they
were studying German and/or Spanish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>When it came to payment for university
tuition, most Maritime Greek students relied on their parents, scholarships,
and money they earned themselves rather than on student loans.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One girl said, &quot;It's a good thing that
our parents work hard and want to pay for our education.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don't expect anything in return.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunately some <span class=GramE>of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>my</span> friends take advantage of this
privilege.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's why I wanted to pay
for my own education.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I did badly,
then I'm to blame.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Coming from a
community with a strong work ethic, and realizing how hard their parents have
had to struggle to provide their families with a decent life in this country,
most of the young Maritime Greeks interviewed were excellent, hard working
students. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>This age group had friends who were
Greek and friends who were not Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Some of them told us that they &quot;hang out&quot; with other young Greeks
almost on a daily basis, while others saw one another only at large gatherings,
usually associated with the Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
told us that they mostly kept their Greek and &quot;Canadian&quot; friends
separate, since they thought that their non-Greek friends would not understand
many of the Greek customs, and they certainly would not understand the Greek
language.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two or three of the girls said
that their best friends were Lebanese girls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When asked about this, they said that they felt comfortable with the
Lebanese girls because they, like the Greek girls, lived with certain
restrictions on their freedom, and knew that to be a female in a
Mediterranean-based culture was a different experience from the typical
&quot;Canadian&quot; upbringing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When
asked about friendships among the Greek themselves, one girl said, &quot;The
Greek youths are a lot closer than a lot of Canadian people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The guys are more comfortable with each
other…they embrace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Canadian people
would be quick to say, 'Oh they are gay.' but they are not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>These young people enjoyed a variety of
leisure time activities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two girls gave
television and radio as their first choice for entertainment, but Tina Piper
calls TV &quot;the opiate of the people, which turns people into passive
participants in life instead of active ones.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That's why I don't watch TV.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Several enjoyed reading and visiting with family or friends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many of these young Greeks belonged to the
church related GOYA, and some of the university students belonged to the newly
reactivated Hellenic Student Association in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> area.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Almost all of them did Greek dancing, or participated to some degree in
Greek dance classes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They constantly
mentioned that activity as important for them in maintaining a Greek identity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>The young people were very interested in
sports.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While they liked a variety of
sports, soccer ranked highest for the boys.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Given the traditional wild enthusiasm which soccer engenders among Greek
men, this was not at all surprising.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
these Canadian Greek boys did not just follow professional soccer matches on
television, as their elders did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
were themselves keen players.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The girls
also enjoyed sports such as field hockey, volleyball, and soccer or they
participated in some sort of active exercise routine such as walking or
aerobics.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The girls' sports enthusiasm
sometimes caused some concern for their parents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One girl reported that &quot;I was never
allowed to join the soccer team.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>School
was first.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lunchtime sports were ok, but
not those after school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They didn't know
that I played sports like hockey and soccer…I would just say that I had to stay
late at school.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another girl
added, &quot;My parents won't let me play sports.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They think <span class=GramE>it's</span>
masculine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Friendships and love interests
between boys and girls are important for most young people, and young Canadian
Greeks are no exception.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For them,
however, there are sometimes extra difficulties.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When asked if they thought they would have a
better and happier life married to someone of Greek, Greek Canadian, or
non-Greek origin, the answers varied but the question always sparked
considerable interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most girls and
boys in this age group said that they preferred the idea of marrying a Greek
Canadian.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The following type of answer
from the girls was common: &quot;I couldn't see myself marrying a 100% Greek
man.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek men are chauvinistic. I would
not want to work or live all the time in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be easier to communicate with a
Greek Canadian.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would make my parents
happier and would make life easier.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Anastasia <span class=SpellE>Mastrogiannis</span>
made a thoughtful comment on the subject:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;I think it is both possible for me to be unhappy married to a
person of non-Greek background and to someone from a Greek background.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think that naturally, however, we become
attracted to people who we can identify with and see part of ourselves in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ideally I would have more in common with
someone that is Canadian Greek, because we have more in common.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be difficult for me to be married to
someone who only spoke English or only <span class=GramE>Greek,</span> because
I feel that I would be losing a part of myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>In a recent interview Danai Sfalagakos
expressed herself this way: &quot;I'm very Greek in certain ways and I would
like to completely share this aspect with my husband.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, even if he were to make the
effort to learn about my culture, it's not the same.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can't explain it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, marrying a Greek would be easier for my
parents - they could communicate perfectly with him and his family.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The final consideration is religion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am Greek Orthodox and changing my religion
is not an option for me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>This group was also asked whether they had
gone out with girls/boys from a Canadian Greek background and/or from a
non-Greek background.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of them
answered that they had dated both Greeks and &quot;Canadians&quot;.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question provoked more spirited
discussion among the girls than among the boys, since the girls’ parents were
often very protective of them, and very concerned that they not become objects
of gossip in the local Greek community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One seventeen-year-old girl had plenty to say on the subject of dating:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>&quot;Greeks here of my parents' age
have a double standard for us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Males are
encouraged to date.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a girl, the rule
is no dating and no small parties with non-Greeks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can go to big school parties, if I
ask.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could never have a boyfriend to
whom I was not engaged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are so
many things that I am not allowed to do that my Canadian friends do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just wish my parents would trust me
more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know what is right and wrong, I
dislike ideas like easy abortion and I would think long and hard about
premarital sex.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our parents haven't
changed in their attitudes to dating since they came here in the 1950s.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Attitudes to sex and dating have changed in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> but not
here in the Maritimes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Some of the older ones interviewed
spoke quite candidly about their relationships with caring, non-Greek men and
women who respected and admired their Greek background.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this modern attitude to love and affection
outside marriage they were very much like their non-Greek friends in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region> - and like many young Greeks in the
cities of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We asked the students what the
criteria are for being Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Birth,
language, culture, and religion were very common answers to that question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When they were asked to define Greek culture,
the students tended to think of Greek history, literature, food, and dance.
However, when we asked them about their favorite music, most said that while
they enjoyed listening to Greek music at Greek functions, they never played it
when they were alone or choosing a tape for the car.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then they played whatever was popular among
the rest of North American teens at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Being Greek in the Maritimes usually
means following the Greek Orthodox faith.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How did the young people see the church in relation to their own
lives?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About one half of the students
interviewed attended <st1:City w:st="on">St. George's</st1:City> Greek Church
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> on a
regular basis and were very comfortable with their religion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other half did not attend church in any
regular way, and they said that they attended church more in their younger
years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One boy remarked,
&quot;Attendance in church is down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
doesn't play the role it used to any more.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the girls remarked, &quot;A lot of
people see church as a social gathering place instead of a religious
setting.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When asked if they
thought the life of the Greek Church in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> was changing, and if they
would like to see more changes in the church, some students noted with approval
the increasing use of English in the services.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The girls grumbled because some people in the congregation at St.
George's reacted negatively, if they wore slacks or jeans to church.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such things as the growing use of English in
church and a definition of what is regarded as an acceptable dress code are
examples of social practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In any
society or community such practices exist in a certain state of flux, and a
given generation may not recognize that permanent changes are taking place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>More difficult for some young Greek
Canadians in the Maritimes are certain traditional Orthodox positions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like some of the adults, at least two
students questioned what they viewed as the negative stance of the Greek
Orthodox Church towards other religions and other Christian denominations,
particularly the Roman Catholic Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Some young women in the Maritime Greek community wanted to see changes
in Orthodox attitudes to women and to find more involvement of women in the
management and public life of the church beyond their traditional roles as servers
of food and supporters of good causes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One teenager told us, &quot;When I was younger, I loved Sunday
school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I grew older I found so much
of the teaching very male oriented and I got very disillusioned.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now I am trying to resolve all the conflicts
I see in our religion, and I find it very hard.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another young woman remarked, &quot;Girls
cannot serve at the altar here, although the Greek Church in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Toronto</st1:place></st1:City> has altar girls.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why can't we?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Halifax Father Theodore Efthimiadis is
aware of the concerns expressed by the young people, and he has said that he
wants to work with them to make them more active in, and more comfortable as
members of the Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He has already
instituted a practice whereby, on the first Sunday of each month young people
play a large part in the morning service, and at least half the service is
conducted in English. Individuals who want to see a more active participation
by women in the life of St. George’s must be pleased by the recent (2000)
election of Dr. Maria <span class=SpellE>Alexiadis</span>, who is in her
thirties, as the new president of the Church Council.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>The interviews sought to find out from
the young people how comfortable they feel in Canadian society.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were asked whether the felt any tension
in trying to be both Greek and Canadian.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In addition, they were asked whether they thought that being Greek, or
in general being from an ethnic community outside the mainstream English and
French communities, resulted in a sense of being discriminated against or
experiencing racial prejudice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most said
that they felt very comfortable in Canadian society.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One girl remarked that she often felt lonely,
but that she knew that was caused largely by her parents' restriction of her
activities outside the Greek community.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Savva <span class=SpellE>Boukistianos</span>, who had spent years living
in Greece and Cyprus, said that he missed the weather, the people, and the
sheer exuberance of life in Greece.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>Some made remarks of the sort which
suggested that they felt <u>some</u> tension between trying to conserve their
Greek cultural background and still being a part of Canada.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that they had noticed some
discrimination and racial prejudice toward Greeks, even if this had not
been<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>directed against them
personally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, two young men
said that &quot;Canadians are not always willing to understand that different
groups of people have different traditions and different ways of behaving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the Greek Festival or in other public
performances, when groups of men dance together in the traditional dances, we
hear all sorts of crude, racially-directed jokes, usually from the young,
non-Greek men in the audience&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
Greek girl said, &quot;In school the other kids want to put people in boxes;
they like to create stereotypes of the kind which say that all Lebanese and
Greeks run grocery stores, or all Chinese are super smart&quot;. The Greek
students were not above suggesting some stereotypes of their own.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the interviews they used remarks such as:
&quot;Canadian kids are not very motivated or ambitious.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One student said, &quot;Their (&quot;Canadian&quot;)
ways are different, and if I have a choice I will stay with the Greeks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way the Canadians discipline their kids
is not nearly strict enough.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>In spite of some negative comments,
usually these young Greek people said that they enjoyed both their Greek
heritage and the Canadian environment in which they were living.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Alethea <span class=SpellE>Lacas</span> of
Halifax who is now in Medical School at Dalhousie University summed up her view
of the positive features in Canadian life by saying, &quot;I appreciate the
various freedoms which we have here, the modern conveniences which we take
mostly for granted, the educational system, the health care, and especially all
the cultural opportunities.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
