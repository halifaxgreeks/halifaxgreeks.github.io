<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Greek people of the Maritimes
are as diverse in their behavior and interests as any other group.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet they have certain common traits which
tend to be particularly characteristic of them as Greek Canadians.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Current (1996) statistics figures provided by
Statistics Canada show that 83% of all adult Greeks in this area are <span
class=GramE>married,</span> and that only 1.6% of them have had a divorce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While it is very much changing with a younger
generation, the Maritime Greeks always tended to prefer Greek Canadians or
Greeks from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as marriage partners. Even ten or twenty years ago, it was fairly normal for
Greek families in the Maritimes to send their teenage children or young adults
to Greece in the hope that through contacts there, they would find marriage
partners and then return to Canada.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Today something like nine out of twelve marriages in the Halifax Greek
Church are between one Greek and one non-Greek person.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus one major challenge for the Maritime
Greek community is to find ways for the community to survive, given <span
class=GramE>the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>changes</span> in the
life of the community that such marriages inevitably bring.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some <span class=GramE>people<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>leave</span> the Greek community as a
consequence of a marriage to a non-Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Others stay within the church and community, but tend to view themselves
and their families as somewhat different from households where both marriage
partners are Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That does not mean
that they and their children are abandoning the Greek heritage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Community tension can result from these mixed
marriages, but this dynamic can also make for growth and positive change.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today many Maritime Greek families are much
more relaxed, much more positively inclined toward marriages between Greeks and
non-Greeks, especially if those marriages have taken place in a Greek
Church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many non-Greeks married to
Greeks have become active participants in the Greek community and feel very
much a part of that warm, close-knit society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>In Maritime Greek homes family
strength and unity are all-important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
often find that the married couple has a strong sense of partnership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many husbands and wives have <span
class=GramE>worked</span> closely together for years in developing and sharing
the responsibility for a family business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In those homes as the children grow into their teens, they often take
turns looking after the small diners, pizza places, or stores which their
parents own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek parents consider
their children (and almost every Maritime Greek family has children) to be the
centre of the home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When it is possible,
the family travels to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>
together.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes a family trip takes
place almost every summer, or the children are sent to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region> to stay
with relatives there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Parties with
grandparents, parents, children of all ages, and extended family members are
common.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is not at all unusual for
whole families to go together to parties and dances at the local Greek <span
class=GramE>church</span> or centre.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Individuals do have private lives apart from their families, and teens
or young adults have their own friends, who may or may not be members of the
Greek community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>In the past, the mother of young
children normally stayed home, and children were rarely left with anyone
outside the immediate family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few
years ago the authors interviewers could not even find a word for
&quot;babysitter&quot; in the vocabulary of Canadian Greeks in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nova <span class=GramE>Scotia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
class=GramE>,</span> such was the disdain for such a non-Greek custom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today as young Canadian Greek women marry,
have children, and attempt to maintain their careers, the patterns are changing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Halifax Lena Blitziotis has opened a
successful day care center, the Lyceum Preschool, which looks after about
thirty children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seven or eight of the
children at the Lyceum Preschool usually come from Greek homes in the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Halifax</st1:place></st1:City> area.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either the children's mothers are working, or
like non-Greeks, the Greek parents want their children to experience a
socialization process with other children before they go to day school.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Lyceum Preschool staff try, where possible,
to speak to the children in Greek, teach them Greek customs, and take them to
special events at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. George's</st1:place></st1:City>
Greek Church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>Most middle-aged and senior Greek women,
even if they work outside the home, take pride in cooking traditional Greek
food.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of the Maritime Greek homes
have a grandmother or y<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>iayia,</b> who
lives with her married children, and does most of the traditional cooking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The children have learned to enjoy roast
lamb, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>moussaka</b> (a sort of ground
meat and eggplant casserole), <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>spanakopita</b>
(spinach pie), and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>kourambiethes</b>
(butter cookies). When the Greek Church or one of its organizations puts on a
social event or fundraising activity, the women of the Greek community are
called on to produce Greek food, sometimes in great quantities, for the event.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whether or not the women are directly
associated with the group requesting the <span class=GramE>food,</span> or
whether they may themselves have major time commitments in other areas of their
lives, most inevitably and cheerfully comply with the request.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One concern in the area of food preparation
is that some of the younger Greek women have not learned, or have not had the
time to do traditional Greek cooking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The older women are sometimes quite protective of their recipes and
unwilling to share them with a younger generation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of the younger women in the community
are now beginning to realize that if they do not soon learn the preparation of
the traditional dishes, those skills will die out with the passing of the older
members of the community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Also characteristic of most Maritime Greeks
is a strong interest and pride in their culture.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have already talked about the great
enthusiasm the young people in the Halifax area show in learning and performing
the traditional dances from Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Teens and adults alike also want to learn something about the glories
and struggles of their Greek past. At local universities such as Dalhousie and
Saint Mary's professors who offer courses in Greek History, Mythology, and
Ancient Art regularly find that they have one, two, or more students of Greek
background in their classes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the
Halifax area it is common for leaders of the Greek Church or for individuals in
the Greek community to invite guest speakers to come and talk about the history
and culture of both ancient and modern Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Many Greek homes contain pictures and artifacts from Greece.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brightly woven fabrics, copies of Greek
museum pieces, and antique brass dishes hold pride of place as home
decorations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Today most Greek families in the
Maritimes prefer not to live too close to one another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some are quite adamant that they do not want
to live in any sort of Greek enclave, and have told interviewers that &quot;we
will move if any other Greeks move into this neighborhood.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Halifax with increased prosperity many
have moved out of the older parts of the city and now live in the west or
central parts of town. Some families are moving outside the peninsula to
recently-developed areas in Dartmouth, Clayton Park, and the Purcell's Cove
Road area where the new St. George's Church is located.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>While in large Greek cities there is
much socializing and interaction between men and women in the cafes, dance
halls, and restaurants, in the villages men still congregate daily at the local
coffee shop or kafenion to smoke, snack, and catch up on all the local
gossip.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Women are almost unknown in such
establishments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we have seen, early
on the kafenion became a regular part of daily life for Greek men in North America.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A very modified version of the kafenion
environment exists in the Maritimes today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is not unusual to see local Greek businessmen in Halifax visiting one
another's stores and restaurants during the day, and stopping for a chat and a
coffee. Other Halifax men of Greek descent spend time at The Club in the city's
downtown where they can relax, shoot some pool, and have a drink in a primarily
male environment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek men in Saint
John regularly drop in at the popular Vitos Restaurant for a coffee or lunch
together.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While there are certainly
exceptions, many of the immigrants who came to the Maritimes after the First or
Second World War had very limited formal education.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They had left behind a war-torn,
poverty-stricken Greece where in rural areas school ended at the sixth grade.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of 109 Maritime Greek women interviewed in
the 1980s, two (1.8%) had never been to school, thirty (28%) had an elementary
school education, three (2.8%) went as far as junior high, forty-three (39.5%)
had partial or complete high school, and thirty-one (28.4%) had been to
university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the time of the
interviews most of the women who had completed high school or been to
university were under forty, or were from the few families who had emigrated
before World War II and had been educated in Canada.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many of those women who came to Canada from
Greece before 1955 never acquired much fluency in English.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They arrived with little or no skill in the
language and they had few contacts outside the family and Greek social
circle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While their husbands did learn
enough basic English to survive in their shops and small business, the women
generally did not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Katina Manos of
New Glasgow who died at 89 in 1991 is typical of the older generation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>She and her husband had come to the New
Glasgow area of Nova Scotia in the 1920s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Some years ago in an interview conducted in Greek she explained that in
her small village near Sparta she had never had the opportunity to go to
school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her poignant words were &quot;it
was more important to keep alive.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Mrs. Manos had six children educated<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>in Nova Scotia.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The girls'
education ended at junior high school, but her two youngest children, both
sons, went on to complete university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One son, Dr. James Manos, is now a university professor and the other,
George Manos, was principal of a school and now is a county councillor in New
Glasgow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of Mrs. Manos' elder
grandchildren are now studying in university, and James Manos two daughters,
Daria and Sarah, are both in medical school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As the older generation of monolingual Greek speakers gradually slips
away, so too do the problems of living in a language, culture, and educational
environment different from the life which they had left in Greece.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Greek families of the Maritimes
today are characterized by a fierce determination to educate their children in
as broad a range of subjects as possible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Several Greek families in the Maritimes send their children to French
immersion programs where these programs are available.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These children learn French as well as
English in day school, and then learn Greek at home and in Greek school at
night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Older Greeks who<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>themselves faced difficulties in receiving an
adequate education in Greece are determined that their children and
grandchildren shall stay in school as long as possible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parents are willing to make real personal
sacrifices in order to provide for their children's education and ensure a life
of opportunity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because of their
parents' support, few Greek Canadian young people need to take out student
loans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today many young Greek Canadians
in the Maritimes have entered and successfully completed undergraduate and
graduate degree programs in a variety of fields.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are becoming established as medical
doctors, lawyers, engineers, accountants, successful business people and
educators.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the Maritime Greek
community young and old alike see education as the key to future success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The determination to preserve the Greek
language in North America and pass it on to the next generation is one of the
most important cultural goals of North American Greeks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many Maritime Greeks keep the Greek language
alive by speaking it at home and by frequent travel to Greece.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The priest at St. Nicholas Church in Saint
John points out that many Greek Canadian families have grandparents living with
them, and that is the primary way through which the children gain regular
exposure to the Greek language. He himself talks in Greek to the children as
much as he can, both informally, and as their teacher in the Saint John Greek
School. Greek schools have been in North America since 1931 and in Halifax
since the 1950s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to the
principal, Callie Iatrou, the Greek School in Halifax, which goes from grades
one to six, and employs two teachers, presently enrolls about 60 children.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That number is down from the high enrollment
days of the 1970s and 80s when the school contained over 150 students.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, a recent increase in the number of
Greek babies in the community suggests that the number of children for the
school will rise again within the next couple of years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>Since the Halifax Greek School
operates as a twice weekly, evening program after the regular school day, it
puts pressure on both students and parents alike.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Funding for the teachers' salaries comes from
a fee paid by participating families, fundraising activities organized by the
school board, and donations of the Church Council.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Greek government, which supplies a large
number of books for the different grades, also provides accreditation for the
school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In theory that means that a
pupil who completes a particular grade in the Halifax Greek School could pass
into the next sequential grade if that child's family moved to Greece.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, given life in a Canadian context, where
the children are surrounded by the English language in their daily lives, it is
very difficult to make a smooth transition from schooling in Canada to that in
Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to Mrs. Iatrou, many
children attending the Greek school in Halifax now come from homes where Greek
is not spoken as frequently as in the homes of earlier generations of Greeks in
the Maritimes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus it is a struggle for
the school to maintain the same standards of spoken and written competence in
the Greek language as in the past.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>Anyone who wants to learn to read and
write Greek has to learn not only a new vocabulary and new, often complicated
grammatical forms, but also a completely different alphabet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That alphabet of twenty-four letters does not
correspond exactly with the western or Latin alphabet, as there are, for
example, two different &quot;o&quot; vowels. What sounds like &quot;e&quot; to
an English trained ear can have a number of spelling possibilities in
Greek.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, some of the capital
letters look very different from the forms used for the lower case
letters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Increasingly, Greek schools
rely on books published in North America rather than in Greece, because the
North American materials use a teaching/learning style likely to be more
familiar to children educated in Canadian schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>Along with education in the Greek
language comes a strong measure of Greek religion, traditions, mythology, and
history.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For Christmas and at the end of
the school year the children give public presentations of poems, songs, and
plays.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Greek schools also foster a
strong feeling of pride for the Greek homeland, one that is founded on the
glories of ancient and modern Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Days such as March 25 or October 28<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>are of special importance for all Greeks, as they remember their
ancestors' struggle for independence from the Turkish and Italian rulers of the
past.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On those days children in the
Halifax Greek School present patriotic poems which they have memorized, put on
plays, and perform traditional Greek folk dances.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dancing itself is a regular, weekly part
of the Halifax Greek School's activities in addition to the more academic
studies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>In the past St. George's in Halifax
has also run Greek language classes for interested adults, but in recent years
such language classes have become available outside the church through Saint
Mary's University.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prof. Niki Hare, who
is a Greek Canadian born in Cyprus, gives these classes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Adult learners of Greek tend to be those with
a strong interest in Greek culture, and a fondness for Greece itself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some students are not Greek by background.
Others are Greek Canadians who wish to improve their Greek, especially their
reading and skills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Still other adult
students have married local Greeks and wish to feel closer to their spouses'
proud cultural and linguistic heritage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

there exist stories, customs, and traditions which add unique features and
color to the life of the people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since
the time of ancient Greece the making of stories and particularly the creation
of myths have been characteristic of the Greek people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This first story is from a Halifax
Greek lady whose family comes from the village of Xerokampi, near Sparta in
southern Greece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here are her own words:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>           </span>&quot;My mother told me a very
moving story about St. Nikonas where an interesting custom about the baking of
the church bread (<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>prosforo</b>) is
revealed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>St. Nikonas was a well-known
saint around the Peloponnese, because he was supposed to have visited it after <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>walking</b> across the Aegean Sea from Asia
Minor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He preached in the Peloponnese
and died there, but nobody knew the place where he had been buried.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One night a little boy, bearing the saint's
name, had a dream in which the saint revealed to him where his bones lay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the little boy told his mother, she was
first frightened and did not say anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Finally she told the priest who summoned the whole village of Xerokampi
into a meeting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They all took their
shovels and started digging until they found the holy bones.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then they transferred the bones to Sparta
where they built a magnificent cathedral bearing St. Nikonas' name.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>           </span>All the villagers took home with
them a little bit of the earth that held the saint's bones.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mother's aunt took some,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and when she baked the bread to take to the
church for her husband's <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>mnemosyno</b>
or anniversary service for his death, she put a tiny bit of the earth in the
dough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She made two round loaves and stamped
them, but one of them looked cracked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That one she gave to a poor man and the other she took to church.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When she went to sleep the next night, she
dreamed that her husband was thanking her profusely for the great gift which
she had sent him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was surprised for
she didn't think that she had done anything special.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In her dream her husband pointed at the
cracked loaf, which he was holding in his hand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That loaf was the one which she had given away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her husband was pointing at a tiny piece of bone,
St. Nikonas' bone, in the loaf.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>St.
Nikonas' feast day is the 26<sup>th</sup> of November.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Greek people of the Maritimes
have brought with them customs and traditions that are important to them as
individuals, as families, and as members of a community.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this book <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>customs</b> are defined as practices which are done over and over again
by individuals and by families.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These
customs may only exist across the life of one person or one family, or they may
have lived in a particular family for a number of generations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While some Greek families in the Maritimes
have customs similar to those in other families, there are often real
differences among families.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Traditions</b> are defined<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>as ways of doing things, which are often
hundreds of years old and are held in common by a great number of people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even within common customs and traditions
certain modifications can be found from one family to another and one region to
another..<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Described below are some
customs and traditions which the Greek people of the Maritimes have remembered
and brought, sometimes in a modified form, from Greece.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Expect to discover slight variations as
people from different parts of Greece tell their stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A wedding always demands special
ways of doing things to help make the occasion memorable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyone planning a wedding begins to consider
styles of clothing, types of food, the nature of the ceremony, and the use of
special, old customs which make us laugh, but also are maintained because
that's the way it always is at weddings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Most of us are familiar with wedding customs such as the garter, which
the bride wears on her leg and the new groom removes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We throw confetti or rice at weddings, and at
the receptions end the new bride throws away her bouquet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>Greek people often do these things
too, but they also have special Greek customs and traditions for weddings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Pota Kouyas of Stellarton whose family
comes from a village in Laconia in the southern Peloponnese, told an
interviewer that it was her family's custom to give a bride and groom each a
spoonful of honey to eat in order to sweeten their marriage and their married
life together.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She also said that
friends of the newlyweds place a horseshoe on the threshold of their new home,
and that the bride and groom each step on it as they enter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This brings good luck to the marriage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Sophronia Georgakakos of Halifax, whose
family also came originally from the southern Peloponnese, but from another
village, added her versions of these wedding customs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Georgakakos said, &quot;When the
marriage ceremony in my part of Greece is over and the bride and groom go home,
they find that the bridegroom's family has placed a steel bar at the entrance
to the house and on the top of the door so that the couple will have a strong marriage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bridegroom's family also makes up a cross
with honey so the bride will be sweet for her new husband.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>           </span>Mrs. Bessie Katsepontes who is from
the village of Palaiopanayia, also near Sparta, gave us her version of the
sweet wedding stories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said,
&quot;In our village before the wedding young village girls- and they must be
unmarried girls- come to decorate the new couple's bed and room with sweets-
usually almonds- which they hide in the new sheets.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes they play small tricks on the
couple with the funny things they hide in their bedroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the church wedding when they are back
in the groom's home, his mother gives the new bride honey in a silver
spoon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>After the bride has eaten the
honey, she throws the spoon behind her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Whoever catches the spoon can take it home as a souvenir.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Greek weddings in the Orthodox
Church have several features, which are both colorful and traditional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, the principal, official sponsors or
attendants of the new couple, the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>koumbaros</b>
(male) and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>koumbara</b> (female), must
be Orthodox and in good standing with the Church.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They may be relatives of the young couple,
but need not be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if not related,
the<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> koumbaroi</b> (plural) are treated
almost like family, and often will be asked to be the godparents of the new
couple's first child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In the wedding
itself the crowning of the bride and groom is the climax of the service.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before the wedding the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>priest has
placed a tray holding two crowns on a small table at the front of the
church.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'> stephana</b> or crowns of fresh or artificial flowers are joined by a
single ribbon and signify the glory and honour with which God is crowning the
couple.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The church teaches that on earth
they are being crowned as the king and queen of their own little kingdom, which
they will rule with wisdom, justice and integrity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the crowning begins, the priest takes
the crowns and holds them above the couple saying,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                     </span>The servants of God
(name) and (name) are crowned<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                       </span>in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>The koumbaros and koumbara then
simultaneously switch the crowns three times above the heads of the bride and
groom to demonstrate that they are being crowned in equality, dignity, and mutual
love and support.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Usually the crowns are
preserved carefully at home on a stand or in a special case close to the
marriage bed, and preferably they are never touched or disturbed, to avoid the
possibility that the marriage itself might be disturbed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Near the end of the wedding service, the
priest leads the bride and groom in a circle or dance around the table on which
are placed the Bible and the Cross.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
walk or dance is always done in great joy- the joy the couple have the right to
expect in their married life and the joy of beginning a new home with the
Christian faith and the Orthodox Church at the centre of their life together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>In Maritime Greek homes January 1st,
St. Basils special day, brings some of the most popular traditions which have
been transferred from Greece to Canada.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Mrs. Antonia Xidos, whose family comes from the island of Milos, told us
that early on January 1st her youngest son, Dino, appears at the doors of the
various family members, bringing with him rocks he has picked up on the
seashore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said: He places a rock
for luck and so the coming year will be strong like the rock under the bed of
the husband and wife in the home. Mrs. Xidos married daughter, Cathy
Mavrogiannis, laughingly admits that she now has a collection of rocks from
numerous years under her bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her mother
says that it is all right to replace last years rock with this years
present, but Cathy is not taking any chances!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Each household bakes its own <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Vasilopita</b>
(cake or bread for St. Basil) to mark the beginning of another year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone hopes to get a lucky coin baked
inside the cake or<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> pita.</b> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>The Vasilopita commemorates a miracle
performed by St. Basil while he was a bishop.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The legend varies as to how St. Basil became the guardian of the gold,
silver, and jewelry of the people of Caesarea in Asia Minor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some sources say that thieves had taken the
valuables from the village and that they were recovered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other sources say that the treasures had
first been required as a tax by a hostile, pagan Roman governor, but that he
was so impressed by St. Basil that he returned the people's treasure to this
good man.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In either case St. Basil was
supposed to return the treasures to the owners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, the villagers could not agree on who owned each particular
valuable piece.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>St. Basil suggested that
the women should bake the valuables inside a large cake or pita.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When St. Basil cut the pita, each owner
miraculously received his or her own treasure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Today a single coin is baked inside each loaf to honour St. Basil's
miracle, and the one who gets the coins is supposed to receive good luck for
the coming year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greek people cut the
first piece of the Vasilopita at midnight on New Year's Eve. The head of the
household first says a blessing and then cuts the cake into pieces in a
specific order which remembers Christ and the saints, as well as family and
friends gathered at the table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Greece
(and we suspect in some Greek Canadian households), a little Vasilopita and
some other food may be left out for St. Basil on his name day, January
1st.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anastasia Botas of Halifax told us
that in her home they don't receive presents on Christmas Day, but the presents
do appear with Saint Basil at New Year's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Like weddings, deaths and funerals
attract patterns of traditional behaviour, which can be very tenacious.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several of our Maritime Greeks have told us
about death rituals from the southern Peloponnese in which the mourners,
usually the local women, create elaborate songs and poems (<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>moirologia</b>) to chant and sing beside the body of the dead
person.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The family of Mrs. Chrysoulla
Raptis of Sydney came from Gythio south of Sparta.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Raptis said, &quot;When my father died,
all the mirrors were covered with black ribbons.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When someone has died, the people sit up all
night around the body.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After someone is
dead and has been buried for three or four years, they take up the bones and
wash them with wine, put them in a box, and keep them in the church.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the family and friends go to the
'opening up ceremony, they say 'we're going to free so and so'.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means the earth somehow keeps the spirit
enslaved, and when the bones are out, the spirit feels free.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we were children, we were terrified to
go near that room full of bones at the church. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>While we in North America may find the
whole idea of the 'opening up' ceremony more than slightly macabre, it should
be understood, at least in part, as a practical way to avoid the expansion of
cemeteries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With this custom the family
tomb is available when the next member of the family dies, and the remains of
the one who has died previously are dealt with in a way that tradition and
church consider acceptable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>Because it is a different cultural
climate, and because Canada has stringent regulations about the disposal of
dead bodies, the practice of the opening up ceremony does not exist in
Canada.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, Greek families do use
other rituals around death which are hallowed by their traditions, and which
help them deal with the terrible finality of losing a loved one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some families it is still common for the
women to adopt total or almost total black in their clothing for a period up to
one year after the death of a close family member.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some women who are widowed may never remove
that black clothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are not
required by any church or community regulations to dress in this way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, in some situations other members of
a woman's own family may find the totality of the black grim and hard to
endure, and ask for its removal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
those women themselves feel comforted by their black attire; they feel that
they want to indicate to the world the grief that is within their hearts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who, then, should look askance at their
dress?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Greek memorial service or<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> mnemosyno</b> which occurs forty days after
the death of a relative, and special days of remembrance for the dead
throughout the church year are other ways through which Canadian Greeks deal
with feelings of bereavement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On those
remembrance days the women prepare, bring to the church, and share with friends
and family a traditional memorial dish called<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'> kolliva</b>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is made of
boiled wheat mixed with sugar, pomegranate seeds, and spices.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The kolliva is a symbolic message of
everlasting life and hope.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For Greek
Christians it is rooted in the words of St. Johns Gospel 12:24 where it says,
Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and
dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. If one is asked
to share a taste of kolliva with a Greek friend, it is a mark of real caring
and expectation that we will understand what is being offered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It means that we participate with our friend
in remembering his or her loss, and we also remember our own dead with
affection and continuing love.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
