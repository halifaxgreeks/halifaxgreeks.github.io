great quality he possessed’? It was his absolute sincerity, a sincerity of
principle, sincerity in every way. He did not, stop to think of what others
would advise, – what he thought was right, what he fe1t in himself was the true
side, that was the thing which he was at once ready to stand for. His sincerity
was the thing which marked him all his life. But there was another trait,
strongly marked, and that was his humility. He never sought for anything for himself.
Just for the good of the Church, just for God: just what he could do for other
people. Through all of his life there was that saintliness of character which
was I think, one of the most charming things about him – to come in contact
with one who was indeed a Saint of God, and I feel that in him was the secret
of the deepest spirit of love. He did indeed believe in what he taught; he
preached indeed what he <span class=SpellE>practised</span>, and I believe he <span
class=SpellE>practised</span> in every way what he preached. His faith was
always strength for him. He lived not so much for earthly advancement, he
looked not for it but he ever looked for that eternal country, for that
heavenly Kingdom where he should serve for ever Him whom he so faithfully
served on earth.” </p>
